With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can\\'t tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey\\'s thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don\\'t the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it\\'s one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don\\'t even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.',\n",
       " 'This didn\\'t feel like Star Wars. Now, I know people said that after viewing The Phantom Menace, but the prequels, despite their flaws, delivered a picture of a larger and more complex galaxy than the one we were introduced to in the original trilogy. The prequel characters were poorly written, scene direction felt off at times, Jar Jar existed, but at the end of the day I\\'ll take the prequels over the new Disney films because they painted a universe. They made me want to see more Star Wars, and I appreciated the original trilogy\\'s story arc even more after watching them. The Last Jedi did the complete opposite. It killed my interest in the Star Wars universe because there seems to be nothing left to care about. The Resistance is just the Rebels. The First Order is just the Empire. No end is in sight. Rey is perfect already. Snoke is dead and no one cared enough to even explain his existence in the first place. The original trilogy might as well just have never happened. We\\'ve had three death stars. No stable political structure seems to be possible in the galaxy, and if it were we wouldn\\'t visit it in the films. For all we know the conflict could be taking place in one tiny sector of the galaxy with the rest of the galaxy completely out of the loop. Sure, some people in a space casino make money off selling weapons and a slave kid has a Rebellion ring now, but that\\'s not enough to establish why I should care about the story anymore. \"They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow.\"The humor was cringe-worthy. Even the characters don\\'t care. Poe\\'s prank-call at the beginning dissolved any anxiety we might feel about his character right out the gate. Star Wars doesn\\'t have to take itself seriously 100% of the time, but its characters should feel like they\\'re fighting real battles. I don\\'t even want to talk about the casino scenes. Disney has no right to lecture us on capitalism. Much of the movie was just scenes lifted from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, cut-and-pasted around in a different order as if we couldn\\'t figure that out. I sense a tone of disrespect for viewers\\' intelligence. Additionally, it is deeply disturbing to me to see critics give this movie such a high rating and then see news outlets publish articles questioning how seriously we should take the backlash. It is not a flaw in the ratings system. Sure, casual and young viewers will enjoy. But the backlash is real, and it\\'s not all crusty old fanboys nostalgic about the good ol\\' days and complaining about political agendas (not that the fanboys always have illegitimate arguments). I\\'m a twenty-two year old woman and I was very disappointed. Star Wars is for everyone. That should include fans, and people who love good stories.',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t hate TLJ, but even if I completely ignore all the (among many fans) controversial choices Rian Johnson made with regards to his treatement of Star Wars\\' lore and characters, I still have a great number of qualms with the film in terms of its storytelling (sorry, this is going to be rather long):PACING: Now that was probably my biggest issue with the film. Apart from the opening battle, the film has very little forward momentum for nearly two thirds of its running time. After the action-heavy beginning, the plot gets tangled in 3 separate storylines which unfold simultaneously. My (perhaps personal) problem was that I found 2 of those neither emotionally involving nor thrilling: the Finn/Rose subplot about finding the code-breaker on the \"Casino Planet\" Canto Bight as well as the Poe/Holdo storyline about the resistance\\' messy escape from the First Order and the universe\\'s most sluggish space chase. But the one story I was ready to get fully invested in - you know: the one about Rey and Luke on the island (and Kylo via Force-Skype) - not only offers very little in terms of action and visual excitement, it also never really gets the time to breathe: because the overall narrative requires the film to cut back and forth between it and the other two evolving story threads. The result of that narrative structure is 90 minutes of scenes with Rey and Luke (and a little Kylo) on a dreary, grey island that beg to resonate emotionally but get blunted each time by the film\\'s need to cut to the (for me) somewhat uninvolving action in Finn\\'s and Poe\\'s part of the universe. And their two storylines lose all sense of urgency because they keep getting interrupted by the scenes on the island with Rey and Luke - which, to make matters worse, develop over several days in the film while Finn\\'s and Poe\\'s stories unfold over a couple of hours.Due to that uneven structure we end up with a two-and-a-half-hour movie where the most crucial scenes of the story never get enough room to breathe and even feel rushed. It\\'s only once all three storylines start coming together during the last third of the film that the film\\'s pacing really works for me. But getting there often feels like a chore (and I\\'m really not sure a Star Wars film should feel like work).ODD CHARACTER CHOICES: What is the purpose of having Leia in a coma for the better part of the film? Don\\'t tell me this is all set up so Kylo thinks she\\'s dead: she\\'s connected to the Force, and he\\'s about as plugged into the Force as one can be; if established Star Wars lore tells us anything, it\\'s that Kylo would instantly feel it if his mother died (now that\\'s something even a casual fan such as myself knows). So why not use Leia more? Why introduce a completely new character in Laura Dern\\'s Admiral Holdo, if she essentially just functions as a stand-in for Leia?Poe Dameron\\'s whole arc in the film is about him learning the terrible human cost for stupid, vain heroism, and it\\'s with Leia that he clashes, after he\\'s sacrificed half the resistance\\' fleet in order to take out a single Dreadnought during the film\\'s opening battle. And as soon as Leia\\'s in a coma, almost the exact same conflict continues with Holdo. Nothing against Admiral Holdo, but it\\'s hard to get invested in her character, because we only just met her; from a storytelling point of view, to make Poe\\'s arc really resonate and raise the stakes for him (and the audience), it would make much more sense if he rebelled against Leia. Wasting her in a coma instead seems utterly pointless.BIG MOMENTS: Unlike its immediate predecessor, TLJ shuns familiar formula. It\\'s not all forward momentum, it\\'s not all action - but unfortunately, it fails to provide the audience with an emotionally involving story instead. It may take characters in unexpected directions, but most of those new directions turn out to be somewhat... rather \"mature\" choices in terms of storytelling instead of exciting ones? Yes, there are several grand moments in the film that work great on an intellectual level, but they fail to reach us on a gut level. Whenever the film tries to build up to a big emotional moment, that moment ends up feeling, well, not very big at all - which naturally could again be a very deliberate choice by the director to subvert the formula, but to what end? Surely, the subversion itself can\\'t be his main goal?For example, take the scene where Rey learns from Kylo that her parents were nobodies and that they\\'re long dead. The problem of that scene is not the reveal itself: it\\'s the scene\\'s execution. It\\'s a huge reveal for Rey, and it should have more weight. It could - and probably should - be the most emotional moment in the film; a heart-felt gut-punch to our heroine, but instead it\\'s just: *fighting* - \"Your parents were nobodies, and they\\'re dead.\" - \"Yes, I feel it too.\" - *fighting continues*. I just don\\'t get why such an important moment is treated so fleetingly.In contrast, look how Lawrence Kasdan and J.J. Abrams staged The Force Awaken\\'s most emotional scene: Han Solo\\'s death at the hands of his own, terribly conflicted son. Now you can say about the film itself what you want, but that scene had a huge emotional impact on the viewer. It had weight. Imagine that scene had just happened during a fight, in a heated moment, only for the narrative to proceed without giving it any room? These are storytelling choices by Rian Johnson that don\\'t do the movie any favors. I would have been ready to applaud the director\\'s (and/or Disney\\'s) decision to try something different after TFA, but I lament this failure to develop emotional gravitas - and the film\\'s unwillingness to ever raise the stakes for its lead characters. Until the very end, I never feel like any of the protagonists are in real danger. Nor are they ever confronted with the shocking consequences of their reckless actions on a personal level; Finn and Poe\\'s great ideas and plans directly lead to the senseless deaths of dozens, if not hundreds of people - but those casualties are just numbers; they\\'re just exploding spaceships we witness from afar; our heroes (and we as an audience) are never forced to feel the full weight of their loss.As a consequence, there\\'s just nothing there to make this war\\'s terrible cost really resonate with us. This film needs a heartfelt punch to the gut; I\\'m all for challenging the protagonists morally and give them intellectually satisfying arcs, but the resulting storylines should still be exciting enough to make your heart pound. And I know I can only speak for myself, but my heartbeat hardly ever accelerated throughout its entire two-and-a-half-hour running time - if at all.TLJ\\'S ISSUES AS A DIRECT SEQUEL: TFA teased a boatload of things to come, and while I\\'m theoretically on board with many of the unexpected directions Rian Johnson took these characters to in TLJ, I am very confused by his decision to ignore so many of the plot threads that were set up by Lawrence Kasdan and J.J. Abrams in TFA. Because due to that unorthodox approach, watching those two films back to back is a jarringly weird experience. Regardless how one feels about TFA, not even bothering to acknowledge what came before isn\\'t just strange - it\\'s almost offending to the many people who were fully invested in its mysteries and could hardly wait for those promised reveals.And don\\'t tell me they have only themselves and J.J. Abrams to blame; no - they had every right to have those expectations: because TLJ IS the direct sequel to TFA. In the same sense that BACK TO THE FUTURE II was the direct sequel to BACK TO THE FUTURE: the kind of sequel that continues only seconds after the first film ends, resulting in one unbroken storyline developing over two films. And of course the director can go into unexpected directions in the sequel - hell: as an audience we want him to. In fact, that IS part of our expectation and one of the reasons we go to the movies (and BTTF II did it brilliantly) - but pretending like important plot points and huge moments in the previous film simply didn\\'t matter or didn\\'t even happen comes dangerously close to playing the audience for fools.Not that an artist (or a huge conglomerate) shouldn\\'t have the creative licence to do that - but if you go down that road don\\'t act surprised about the inevitable backlash. And I honestly don\\'t get why going into new directions had to result in such an uneven transition from the first film to the second; the way I see it, even a couple of lines of dialog from characters like Luke, Snoke or Kylo-Ren would have been enough to tie some of the most prominent lose ends up or at least not just leave them dangling in the air like this. I mean, I get that Johnson doesn\\'t want us to be interested in Snoke\\'s story (and a whole bunch of other things that were made to feel important in TFA) because HE isn\\'t interested in it. But as a writer he could get that point across and still address the issue (because the previous film told the audience to BE interested in it) - just to then quickly resolve it in an offhanded manner and take the story where he wants it to go.SUMMARY: The Last Jedi is a structurally uneven and often frustrating film that almost always refuses to give its heroes - and the audience - satisfaction. It is a film that over large stretches of its running time is so concerned with subverting the formula and teaching lessons about the importance of failure, that it fails to realize how watching your heroes fail over two and a half hours may be unexpected, but frankly - it\\'s also a bit tiring.It may have been a gutsy and very unexpected move by Johnson to throw out most of the mysteries teased in TFA, but the question only audiences - and time - can answer is whether what he offers instead is a worthy replacement.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/',\n",

       " 'I had relatively high expectations of the Episode VIII. Unfortunately, \"The Last Jedi\" has so many plot holes, inconsistencies, ripoffs from previous movies, annoyingly flat and underdeveloped characters and dialogs, that it deserves many bad reviews that it receives from the public. It could have been so much better...PLOT HOLES and THINGS THAT DOESN\\'T MAKE SENSE - examples:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vice Admiral Holdo, for no reason at all, doesn\\'t inform Poe and other members of the Resistance about the planet Crait and the escape plan. This creates Poe\\'s unnecessary mutiny, just to fill the movie with some unneeded drama and to make cheap \"twist\" when we realize what the Leia\\'s and Holdo\\'s plan is.BB-8 overpowers and ties 3 prison guards armed with blasters, and muffles their mouths... ALONE.Not enough convincing reasons are shown to explain Skywalker\\'s decision to abandon his sister, friends, whole Republic and Resistance, even if they all get killed during his exile. That decision, and the decision to kill Ben, is not in line with Luke\\'s character from the previous movies.Why did Luke make a map which shows his location, and then put a map piece in R2 and gave a map piece to Lor San Tekka, if he didn\\'t want to be found? Whole story about \"The map to Skywalker\" from Episode VII is now illogical...Not even ONE information about Snoke\\'s background, long-term plans, source of his power, etc.? Unbelievable how they wasted that character....Water ends up on Kylo\\'s glove after \"Force connection\" talk. That looked completely out of touch with how the Force works in the previous movies. The same problem is present in the scene with Yoda\\'s Force ghost, when he summons real lightning from the sky and therefore directly influences events in the real world (and then he laughs about that like a lunatic).Why all armies in the galaxy don\\'t use \"hyperspace torpedoes\" to ram spaceship fleets of the enemy, like Holdo did with the Resistance\\'s spaceship, if that is so effective tactic?Also, why Resistance\\'s ship commanders have to stay and die on their ships when all fuel is spent? We are shown that a ship without fuel is useless in any case, and so their death is also useless...Leia survives WITHOUT A SCAR massive explosions that killed everybody else on the ship\\'s bridge, and she also survives vacuum of space (Jedi are not immortal, and without a space suit a Jedi / human would not survive for more than 60 seconds in space). Then she somehow moves herself through space back to the ship, while her dress is waving like the wind is blowing in space.Luke gives Han\\'s golden cubes (dice) to Leia, knowing they have great emotional value to her, although he is aware that cubes will vanish in about 20 minutes because they are also \"Force projection\". That was a very cruel thing to do (and something that Luke wouldn\\'t done)... A few minutes later Leia is leaving cubes behind when she escapes from the base, although our logic tells us that she would keep them. By the way, Leia and Kilo were able to hold dice in their hands. How? Han\\'s golden cubes were \"Force projection\", and Luke showed us while he was \"fighting\" Kilo that Force projection is like a Force ghost - it could not be touched or held. BB-8 manages to disable guards by shooting a pile of golden coins at them. The BB-8 has special compartment for storing coins, and special device for shooting them? And so much coins were inserted in him in the casino? And coins are enough to disable the guards? Silly...BB-8 is piloting AT-ST walker alone, AND he is firing its cannons with great precision in the same time. 4 hands were needed for that in the \"Return of the Jedi\"...Finn and Rose parked their spaceship on the beach of the casino planet, where it was easily seen and reported to the police, although they came there on a secret mission and should have landed on some hidden spot. That doesn\\'t make sense...Finn and Rose enter the casino dressed in their usual clothes, although they don\\'t want to draw attention to themselves. That was so naive and stupid... Would not be a better idea if they picked something to wear similar to those rich people around them? Rose is wearing dirty mechanic clothes when they enter the casino...Finn and Rose are releasing \"space horses\" from the stable, but not the children-slaves.Finn and Rose are trying to escape from the casino planet as soon as possible by riding \"space horses\", although they still didn\\'t completed their mission (they didn\\'t enlist help from a codebreaker). Why? As far as they know, the fate of the Resistance depends on finding the codebraker, but they just flee...On the planet Crait, Rose and Finn have relaxed, slow romantic scene and they share a kiss, while army of gigantic AT-ATs in front of them are firing on anything that moves, and First Order is just about to kill all their friends. Also, their \"love story\" was totally unnecessary and unconvincing.How is Finn (who is dragging Rose\\'s body) able to cross the great distance back to the Rebel base after that, without being attacked? Kilo Ren is not suspicious when Luke holds the same lightsabre on the planet Crait as the one which was split in half shortly before that, when Kylo was confronting Rey.Rey falls into a body of water on Ahch-To and swims easily to the shore. She has spent her entire life on a desert planet. When did she learn to swim? Chewie, R2-D2 and C-3PO do almost nothing during the movie, they are there only because the movie should \"feel\" like a Star Wars movie to the older fans.Too much unnecessary jokes and humor, and too much Porgs - just to please kids who will buy Star Wars toys later...Poe\\'s phone-prank at the beginning of the movie was cringe-worthy. That was the first sign for me that this movie may not be so great as I hoped it would be.Phasma was again completely wasted character, without any purpose in the plot (other than to boost sales of the action figure).RIPOFFS FROM THE ORIGINAL SAGA - 3 examples:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Taken from \"The Empire strikes back\": Surface battle on the remote white planet, complete with AT-AT walkers, low flying rebel fighters, secret rebel base hidden under the surface, trenches, rebel cannons, etc. (Battle oh Hoth)Taken from \"Return of the Jedi\": Kylo (Vader) brings Rey (Luke) to the Snoke (Emperor), while Rey (Luke) is hoping that Kylo (Vader) can be turned from the Dark Side. Snoke (Emperor) shows Rey (Luke) how the Rebel fleet is destroyed while they speak. Snoke (Emperor) has Rey\\'s (Luke\\'s) lightsabre beside him, which Rey (Luke) wants to get by using Force. Many parts of the dialogue are almost the same.Taken from \"Return of the Jedi\": Millennium Falcon is chased by TIE-Fighters through the mines of mineral planet Crait - that scene is almost exact copy of the chase through the Death Star in the Return of the Jedi, where we also had TIE-Fighters chasing Falcon through similar tight spaces and obstacles (they just painted them red in this movie).There are many more reasons why this movie is a failure... If you go to see \"The Last Jedi\", turn off your brain, banish all hopes, and just enjoy beautiful cinematography. At least they have done that right.',\n",
       " \"They are making too many movies, I think. The story is uninteresting, the acting is somehow weak. It seems a little unsure or perhaps the actors are reacting to a poor script. I have watched all the new Star Wars so far and I don't feel like watching anymore because to be honest with myself they are uninteresting. There are better movies out there or I can just do other stuff.\",\n",
       " 'The Last Jedi is obsessed with the fallacious idea that in order to move forward you have to destroy everything that came before. It is as if someone walked into the Louvre and said \"you guys need to stop holding onto the past,\" and then threw a torch down, cackling as hundreds of years of irreplaceable works of art burned to the ground, and then, standing triumphantly on the ashes, drew a smiley face.In order to make room for the new characters to shine, Rian Johnson obliterates the character of Luke Skywalker to the point that Hamill himself couldn\\'t recognize him; in the Original Trilogy Luke Skywalker transforms from a whiny farm boy into a hero who proclaims \"I am a Jedi, like my father before me\" and manages to do what both Yoda and Obi-Wan thought impossible: bring Darth Vader back to the light. In this film, Luke is tempted to murder his own nephew before he even did anything wrong simply because there is a chance he may turn to the dark side, but the worst thing is that after that rather than attempt to fix his mistake he falls into a pit of despair and hides on an island as his friends are slowly wiped out by the First Order. When Rey arrives he refuses to train her or help the resistance in any way (despite having made a map to his location in the previous film), until a strange out of character pyromaniac Yoda force ghost appears and tells him Rey is perfect already and also the extremely cliched line that \"the greatest teacher, failure is.\" Luke is not the only wasted character from the Original Trilogy either: Chewbacca serves as nothing more than comic relief and Leia is incapacitated for most of the film after a strange Mary Poppins-esque stroll through outer space. Admiral Ackbar is killed so unceremoniously you barely even notice he dies.The usage of the force in this film is wildly inconsistent with the previous films as well. First of all, force ghosts never were able to alter physical reality, yet in this film Yoda is able to bring lightning down from the sky, leading us to the question of why the force ghosts haven\\'t just destroyed Snoke from their impenetrable positions in the netherworld. Leia is able to fly through outer space, and Snoke can force push people from across vast distances. Rey is able to lift multiple tons of boulders with apparent ease despite how difficult it was for Luke to make a single X-Wing in the Empire Strikes Back even budge. The force projection that Luke does at the end is actually interesting, but for some inexplicable reason they decide to make it kill him.From a critical standpoint, the film is an incoherent mess. There is little to no character development and the plot is little more than a long, drawn out series of \"gotcha\" moments; we are treated like dogs, as Rian Johnson dangles delicious treats above us before rapidly yanking them away. In the climax of The Force Awakens Rey finds Luke and extends his lightsaber, but in The Last Jedi Luke merely throws the lightsaber over his shoulder. Leia is sucked into outer space, only to magically force fly back to safety. Luke agrees to train Rey, but then quits after only one pathetic training session. Finn is about to heroically save what\\'s left of the resistance, but - surprise! - he is saved at the last minute by his awkward love interest. Snoke is the most powerful sith in any Star Wars movie ever, but is anticlimactically killed by a cheap trick. The entire first half of the movie leads us to believe Kylo Ren and Rey will join forces, but after Kylo Ren saves Rey - surprise! - they\\'re not going to work together: Kylo Ren will remain the stereotypical bad guy and Rey the infallible heroine. Rian Johnson had a chance to actually do something original and daring in this respect, but instead chose to take the safe route.The writing in this film is atrocious. Several lines are lifted verbatim from the Original Trilogy. The humor is out of place, overused, and sounds like they took the words of a heckler writing in the margins and thought they should actually put it in the movie (Star Wars meets Rocky Horror Picture Show). We are distracted by pointless subplots that are of no consequence. The new characters have no personality and sound like modern day buffoons who were simply transplanted into the Star Wars universe. There is so much wrong with it that you really just have to see it for yourself, although I would recommend not paying money for it. In conclusion, The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It is heretical. It is the anti-Star Wars. It stinks.',\n",

It was never explained why she stayed on the cruiser, since the shuttle escape was a secret. (They didn\\'t know yet they had been betrayed).

The story failed to draw me in and entertain me the way The Force Awakens and Rogue One did. I just shook my head at the end, and felt meh about the entry.

       " \"After seeing the unbelievable rating of this movie, I have never felt further removed from the average Star Wars fan. I wasn't a fan of The Force Awakens, feeling it was derivative of previous Star Wars movies. But, in spite of my distaste for the movie, I understood what there was that people liked about it. It was nostalgic to see old faces. Rey, Finn, BB8 and Po were each likeable characters that I felt worthy of leading future movies. The action and effects were excellent. There were hints that we were going to see more with the force in future movies. Most of all there was promise. Therefore, yes, I get how people can see that movie in a different light to how I see it. But this? I just don't get it. The Last Jedi was so tedious that were it not a Star Wars movie, I would have walked out of the cinema within an hour. I'm not talking about a slow burn here, I speak of unrelenting tedium and mediocrity. There are fundamental problems at the story level that made it impossible to get hooked by this movie and should have been fixed long before it went into production. The pace was glacial, and when things finally happened, they were anticlimactic at best. Talking of fundamental problems at pre-production levels, why don't we talk about the script. Not only is the story underdeveloped and poorly plotted, but the dialogue is attrocious. When it's not being cheesy and cringe worthy, it is more wooden and unbelievable than even what we saw in the prequel movies. There was cheese in the original trilogy dialogue, but it was earned off the back of powerful characters, great performances and other genuinely inspired lines.Being as there are such strong problems with the story and script then, it is hard to hold the actors at fault for the lack lustre performances in this movie. All of the acting fell flat in The Last Jedi. None of the emotion (what litlte there was) felt real to me, and as such I just didn't feel any steaks to get me hooked. *** Now we move into serious spoiler territory... you've been warned. *** I am not an editor, but even I could easily cut a third off this movie with a single paragraph. If when Po first confronted the admiral about her plan she had simply explained it, Finn's entire storyline could have been cut from the movie and they would have ended in the same place. Finn would have no need to go off on his hunt for the 'Code Breaker' and the story would have been tighter for it. I get that the film makers didn't want to give the plan away to the viewer, but considering that part of the movie takes up the majority of the second act, it is a really weak premise to hold to. Not only this, but if you cut away this farce, the movie would have been considerably shorter, much cheaper, and the pacing would have been infinitely more bearable. Now let's move onto Snoke. You know, this strange being that was teased in The Force Awakens as the next big thing and has sparked so much speculation in the Star Wars community for the last two years? Yeah, that guy. Well he is little more than a plot device. Insanely powerful in the force, yes, but a plot device none the less. He exists only as a way of bringing about Kylo and Rey's story which just made their story seem artificial and forced. So there's another third of this movie wasted. So the last third of this movie is the Luke Skywalker and Jedi story. Surely that's going to make up for it, right? No. Sadly not. Luke has returned to the spoiled, flawed character of the first movie who just wants to sulk about the fact that he cant go off with his friends to pick up some power converters. There's even a moment in the movie where Yoda actually points this out. That means that it was a conscious decision to tear down the protagonist of the original trilogy that has spawned 4 decades of love and an enormous universe of stories. The decision to do that boggles the mind. Basically, this movie was a mess from beginning to end. It gets 1-star for the visuals (though there was a lot of bad CGI in this movie), and one more star simply because I don't think this movie is the worst movie in cinematic history. It's watchable at the very least, which is reason enough for that second star. I certainly have no hope for the new trilogy Rian Johnson has been employed to write.\",\n",

Here, we have a ridiculous stew of new pawns thrown into the mix who end up amounting to nothing. The characters we do care about are under-utilized. Phasma has an underwhelming death after once again being absolutely worthless and without consequence. The other two deaths in the film are that of the two female characters who are introduced with minimal development. And... how did Luke die? He just decided to drift off into oblivion in the same fashion as Yoda? This made sense for Yoda in Return of the Jedi as he was way beyond his years. But Luke here basically just commits suicide. Genuine drama and momentum is traded in for cheap twists and a non-stop urge to be humorous instead of taking itself seriously. Several of the jokes are cringe-worthy, as if a room full of aspiring comics sat around and said \"Hey, wouldn\\'t this be kinda funny if we had this character do this?!\" and then they just included every possible outlet for humor with zero discretion. Trading in fluid and impactful story-telling for an overabundance of cheap laughs... something that no Star Wars movie til now has dared to do.I was genuinely excited to explore the true nature of The Force in this installment, but I was sorely mistaken in that department as well. The dialog during the training scenes is simplistic, rehashed from The Empire Strikes Back, but in a dumbed-down way. No new or innovative ideas are brought up, and as Luke trains Rey, he does so with an air of mockery. To those who have found actual insight, emotion, and philosophical resonance in The Force, the way this movie handles the subject is beyond insulting. Also- I understand Leia is strong with the Force- but are we really supposed to believe that Jedi can survive being THROWN INTO OUTER SPACE now?? Where do we draw the line? These are human characters we\\'re dealing with, but Mr. Johnson apparently has no boundaries.And his final shot? A boy who we have NEVER SEEN BEFORE. I understand the meaning behind it- to say that anyone can be force-sensitive- but really?! For me, Star Wars has always been about the characters. So when one considers the closing shot of the movie (which has, in other Star Wars films, always been highly poignant) to be a RANDOM BOY... instead of a character that we\\'re actually invested in... you\\'ll see why I am upset. Adding even more questions to the list of unanswered mysteries introduced in The Force Awakens, this episode has me seriously concerned for the culminating chapter of this trilogy.

He was more right than I ever could have known.The plot is stupid and is full of moments where my friends and I looked at each other and said \"wait, what?\". There are sequences in this movie that simply do not need to exist and provide literally nothing to the story.

I am ashamed to have paid money for this and as a long-time Star Wars fan it hurts to see just how dead the franchise I love really is.

Wow, so glad I didnt pay to watch this.1st of all, the replacement characters remain unlikable because dialog and character building is poor. Attempts at humor are not funny nor charming, and the plot development might as well be written by someone with a high school level intellect. Plot holes abound in what is sadly yet another attempt at a retelling of the same story from the 80s... how you can make more plot holes in a story remake?

The sensitive storm trooper who didnt want to kill can now kill all his brethren with a smile. And oh apparently the rebel are now so dumb that they dont even consider looking around for an exit when they are trapped, that is until the magnificent leader says they should look around and after asking Lea if its ok to look around with him... lol. Luke who is supposedly a master Jedi at this stage in his life, is now the guy who either died due to being out of shape or by a 3rd rate sith dork who lost to a storm trooper in melee combat. But he sure fooled him for a minute to allow a group of worthless idiots to escape... I guess this was his Obiwan moment when he went up against a full powered Darth Vader and had no chance of winning... except in Lukes case it was against a kitten with the IQ of a wet towel. They basically took a dump on all three original movies (and even the prequels if you care about those) as well as all the written lore that came after not to mention common sense. Luke got killed while projecting his hologram... why? To give the rebels time to escape when all they had to do was look around for an exit and shoot themselves out. But they were too dumb to figure that out. It took sacrificing Luke (who didnt actually need to die, he could have pulled out the second they started looking for an exit) and Rei to move a few rocks to do what would have been trivial with the guns and equipment the rebels had with them. And all this happened why? Because they ran out of gas lol.Good bye Star Wars.',\n",
       " \"As much as I wanted to love this movie, it utterly failed to deliver on so many levels. Disney, in all its previews, advertised the film as a serious epic focused on Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren, with no doubt some appropriate comic relief as always. What they delivered was a farce-tripping over itself with excessive and ill-timed humor such that no scene could ever be taken seriously, even ones that were intended to be. That combined with frenetically paced scene transitions, too many new characters, and wasted sub-plots (casino scenes), meant the main story and characters were left undeveloped with few burning questions answered. The main premise, equivalent to a slow motion car chase with the First Order chasing the Resistance until they run out of fuel, was absolutely ridiculous. Perhaps most unforgivable of all was the treatment of Luke Skywalker. While initially promising, his diminished role and ultimate end were insulting to his character and inconsistent with everything we know about him. Shame on Rian Johnson.In the end, Disney got lazy and knew that no matter what, they'd make a ton of money off people who want to see a huge lightsaber fight and lots of space battles with big special effects. They forgot that lots of people actually like movies that, on top of all that, are written and produced with enough thought and care so as to not appear like a fifth-grade homework assignment put together 30 minutes before it was due.Not worth the paper the ticket was printed on.\",\n",
       " 'Hello All! I would first like to say that I just created an account just to review this film! This is mainly because I feel so strongly after viewing this film what I think is wrong with hollywood and big block busters today... bad storytelling. Starting off, I am somewhat a fan of Rian Johnsons past work. I recommend Brick to all of my friends and think it is a very well thought out modern Noir story. I even enjoyed Looper which I thought was an imaginative take on time travel. Though a major concern among people who have seen it and some critics is that it is filled with plot holes. Unfortunately it seems as though Mr. Johnson did not read these reviews... I am not a massive star wars fan. I never read the books, the comics or even watched the clone wars television series. I am not a die hard fan for Star Wars. But I am a die hard movie fan. I love movies for their storytelling qualities that let the audience experience something new and different. This major quality that I enjoy most in movies unfortunately is not found in The Last Jedi. Something that I will be referencing throughout this review is the term \"Deus Ex Machina\" which is a term used to describe a \"God Device\" or something found in a plot that arrives just as though a God put it there. I will use it very loosely to point out weak plot points that simply do not make any sense. Other reviews talk about how certain actors act and how some things don\\'t feel right for Star Wars in general. I do not feel like I am knowledgeable enough to point out these flaws. So for all intensive purposes I would like to focus on the story just like I would for any other film. Now to the meat of my review! throughout the film certain things happen in the story that save characters from peril or fix problems they have. Comparing this to real life, we all have had occurrences where something Lucky happens to us and are saved from something horrible. But this does not happen over and over and over again. Starting from the beginning Leia is thrust out into space and is presumed dead. Nowhere in the past films has she been able to observably use the force and mostly can feel things through the force. How is it that right when she is flung to space she manages to not only be able to use the force but can do something that has never even been seen within the franchise? The entire focus in the first act is that the rebels main ship can barely stay out of range from the First Order. How come the First Order doesn\\'t just speed up? Use just a smidge of light speed to cut ahead and become in range? this goes beyond the realm of possibility that they would just drag along behind them and not make the first move when they know they are weak. 3. The entire Finn story line is expendable. It could have never happened and the story could have still ended where it did. When writing I would think that you would look at the story and make sure every single ounce of the story was crucial to get from point A to Point B. Looking at the Finn story it is littered with Deus Ex Machina\\'s for instance when they get arrested. They just so happen to meet someone in the cell who can break into the First Order? Later on, Finn fights Phasma then she happens to fall and die (waste of a character). Then Rose magically arrives with a small ship to get them off the burning ship. Later they crash onto the \"salt planet?\" and manage to be the only ship that gets into the hanger alive. WHAT ARE THE ODDS! I don\\'t want to talk for hours so my last point with Finn is that before Hologram Luke gets barraged with laser canons, Rose passes out. So between Rose passing out and Hologram Luke gets blown to pieces Finn runs across this \"salt field\", Through laser explosions? and gets Rose back to the base in less than 5 miniutes. I\\'m not even kidding look at the distance between the base, where he landed and the time when Hologram Luke gets attacked. Its ridiculous and makes no sense whatsoever.There are other points I could bring up, like Finn getting rescued last minute by Rose. Snoke just so happened to get out of character and trust Kylo RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE SENSED HIS CONFLICT. Like yep... just said I didn\\'t think you were a full Sith but now I trust you and I\\'m going to close my eyes. Or the rebels luckily finding an escape root from their new ice fox friends. To conclude, the story is weak because so much happens through blind luck. This is what bad writing looks like everyone! Whenever someone sits down to write there has to be a cause and effect. There is none here. Just cause and luck. It just simply did not make any sense.This does not span to just Star Wars, but all of Disney\\'s films. They lack good story elements that are either extremely predictable or just have random things save them right when they are in trouble. Do not be fooled by the great acting and flashy effects THIS IS BADLY WRITTEN. They say you support something with your money. So from now on I will not be paying to see a Disney owned and operated film for a long time. I am officially fed up with Star Wars, Marvel and dare I say Pixar. Please Disney stop destroying good storytelling and rehashing other peoples ideas!That is all.Thank You if you read all of this!!-TheFlood',\n",

Other reviewers are probably nailing all the fine details but for me, from the beginning, the writing was uninspired, shaky, and poor. The forced comedy and cheap one-liners all in place it simply DID not belong. Cutaways to the porgs, which I thought I would love and ended up being there purely for kids and merchandising options. Come on, Luke dusting off his shoulder? Throwing the saber over the cliff? And Hux, a character who was set up to be hard and terrifying, was made into a Three Stooges style punchline character almost. Poe was one-dimensional. Holdo was completely unnecessary and looked more like a citizen of the Hunger Games Capital than a character in SW. Finn had so much promise before for an amazing tale. But his and Rose\\'s storyline could have been completely taken out. Boring, uninspired, and just plain silly.Kylo and Rey\\'s storyline force bond was the only thing that interested me as I hung in there, waiting for some redeemable moment of the movie. But Rian Johnson and company seemed way more determined to write a bunch of trash twists just to go \"GOTCHA\" to the audience.Well I don\\'t like cheap tricks. There\\'s a difference between good plot twists and bad ones. These were ALL bad, including Leia\\'s sudden space walk many are compared to a Poppins like moment.This is the first Star Wars movie to ever have left me feeling so numb. I don\\'t want to speculate about future films. I don\\'t care about theories or meta anymore. By the end of the night, hours after we left the theater, I felt totally gutted and crestfallen to realize what the Star Wars sequels have become. Well, no thanks to episode 9. I\\'m done seeing the franchise i love being butchered by Disney. This was the biggest disappointment of my life.',\n",

I am all for social justice, against racism and my parents were not siblings like the MAGA idiots, but this film was boring, lazy, had terrible so-called actors and of course no set design. There were no apparati or decorations anywhere. This film was just a stupid attempt by the capitalists at Disney to make mullah from the suckers. That.is.all.If people stopped going to watch 18 Marvel movies a year and 3 Star Wars movies a year and 12 Marvel TV series and 16 Disney remakes of cartoons we have already seen 16 times a year then Disney and its hyper capitalist bean counters would go the way of the type writer.As for the controversy regarding Rose or whatever her name was (I cannot remember her name, the girl in the hangar) it is not that she was Asian. It was that she is useless, ugly and cannot act. And just to be sure she is not singled out, neither can the stupid SkypeForce calling girl Daisy.

You can enjoy this movie if you're simply want to see some space ships fighting, some aliens, thrown in, random politcal correct messages without any connection to the splot, some Marvell humor and no story telling at all.Of course there are quite a lot of bad movies out there, but nobody really cares about Transformers after watching the crap, right? This is different with Star Wars. This franchise connected so many people all over the world from all countries, ethnics, both male and female. What this movie does is to completely disconnect people and ruins almost everything Star Wars stands for. And in addition to this it also ruins it's legacy.I am not a hard core fan, i did not read any books or comics, just saw the movies. I did not really like the prequels, but at least George Lucas tried to tell an original story, but failed in execution. Episode 7 was okay as a reboot and Rogue One was my hope, that Star Wars can grow up into a great adult space epic, since although the story of R1 wasn't that good, the tone was excellent and catched everything i hoped for. Also the characters were believable if you consider the short screentime they had.In The Last Jedi it seems, that they tried to put everything into which needed to be in a commercial sci-fi kids movie, please some fans, include as much twists as possible just to the sake of surprise plus add the most obvious and cheap political correct statements possible. Yes, you can do that, but you need a really good plot, a vision and a perfect directing to match all these things together. And this is where you completely failed, Mr. Johnson.This movie is a desaster in story telling, pacing, tone, character development and also disrespectful to the legacy of Star Wars. It's an insult to both Star Wars fans and good movie makers in general.For me, this is the end of Star Wars. I wish this episode never happened and would be wiped out of the trilogies.\",\n",
       " 'A movie that tries extremely hard to be politically-correct, while being inclusive and embracing diversity, that it forgets what it means to be a part of the Star Wars lore. One of the greatest protagonists in cinematic history has been reduced to an uninspiring hermit drinking milk off an alien-cow-dinosaur hybrid. Supreme Leader Snoke could potentially be a greater villain than Darth Sidious but unfortunately killed off, Darth Maul-style. Meanwhile, forgettable and insignificant token characters such as Finn and Rose were kept alive all in the name of \"multiracial-diversity\" and \"political-correctness\". And don\\'t get me started on the space battles: It was vomit-inducing.There was an estimated 4-5 First Order Star Destroyers including the massive Snoke\\'s personal flagship, all armed to the teeth with thousands of turbolasers, hundreds of laser batteries, tractor beams, anti-ship torpedoes, and this movie is telling me that none, and yes, NONE, of them could take out one feeble Resistance cruiser? And don\\'t forcefeed me with that \"oh they\\'re out of our range, so at the moment, we could just continue pursuing them for several hours and hope they would eventually run out of fuel\" reasoning. General Hux could have just deployed his entire squadron of TIE Bombers, strategically targeting the cruiser\\'s engines and shield generators, and poof! Mission accomplished.Wow, didn\\'t know that the mighty First Order Dreadnought that is capable of orbital bombardment was extremely vulnerable to \"vertical-dropping bombs that defies space physics\" from ONE Resistance bomber.The \"finding the codebreaker at the Casino-Monaco Planet\" storyline was grossly unnecessary and a borefest.

THE LAST JEDI is being rejected because it didn't deal with any of the questions that THE FORCE AWAKENS spent so much time asking. Who are Rey's parents? It doesn't matter. Who is Snoke? Shrug. We're going to save Luke Skywalker until the last few seconds. Why? So he can spend almost the entirety of the next movie doing absolutely nothing.Mark Hamill has said in interviews that he disagreed with Rian Johnson's take on Luke Skywalker, and THE LAST JEDI reveals that Hamill was spot on. Luke's reasoning in the film makes no sense. Even if he doesn't want to train any more Jedi, he should still want to stop the First Order and help his sister. One thing has nothing to do with the other. That Han Solo's death doesn't even motivate him is a betrayal of the original trilogy and everything those characters went through. If you're going to make a movie about Luke Skywalker, master Jedi Knight, something the entire original trilogy built to, don't you want to see what one of the greatest Jedi Knights can do?Basically THE FORCE AWAKENS was to spotlight Han Solo and this movie was to spotlight Luke Skywalker, but this movie is about Luke doing nothing. Watching Luke do nothing for 90% of his screen time simply doesn't work as drama. What's even worse is we know that Luke will come around or else there would be no story. The original trilogy is about Luke leveling up. Now we should get the payoff, and the ending looks like it's going to give it to us, but then it does a bait and switch and it turns out Luke was never really there.Think of how awesome the ending would be showing Luke tossing First Order walkers through the air? Giving Luke this kind of moment wasn't necessary specifically for this movie except that Johnson purposely had Luke do nothing instead. If you're going to do that, then you have to counterbalance Luke's inactivity with Luke doing a lot in the end, which he doesn't, and then he died, so that mean we won't ever get to see the culmination of Luke's Jedi training. What a wasted opportunity.\",\n",

       " 'First of all, I\\'m a big Star Wars fan, and I think the prequels were good, because they were building up to something, Vador. But this... Where is THIS going...? It\\'s the first time in my live that I\\'ve taken the time to write a review, because there is no way this movie deserve his 8.1/10 rating. And five years old kids don\\'t come to rate movies on IMDB, so people were clearly paid to rate this movie past 5 stars.At first, I thought it was a Family Guy parody. Poe talking about General Hux\\'s mother and making him look like a fool. Jedi Temple Maids!?!?! LUKE MILKING A WEIRD CREATURE, WHAT THE..!?Every mysteries JJ Abrams brought to us with The Force Awakens; Snoke, Rey\\'s Parents, Rey\\'s Vision, Luke &amp; Kylo backstory all lead to nothing... Everything was answered like if Rian Johnson didn\\'t agree with JJ Abrams first view on the Trilogy and wanted to get rid of it right away. I can\\'t believe he gets his own trilogy.But who were the writers on this movie!? Why did they decide to shoot Leia\\'s ship if they didn\\'t want her to die. Waking up &amp; flying in space, really? All that so we can finally get rid of Admiral Ackbar? What was the point of the \"Casino mission\"? (Maz\\'s character appearance was pointless by the way) Finn and his new \"nobuddy\" were really going to leave satisfied with only freeing a weird horse? That\\'s what they were going to do if they were not rescued by that weird traitor code cracker.How did Captain Phasma survived the first movie? And for what? To just die AGAIN!Why did Luke look so afraid of Rey turning to the dark side to then just decide to keep training her the next morning? They really lost me there, at one point I thought there was a mistake in scene editing and this scene was supposed to come later in the movie.What about Snoke... he was supposed to be so powerful. What was he doing?? - And now my young apprentice I fully trust you, I know everything about you! I can read all your thoughts and I will say everything you think out loud until you strike me with the lightsaber just beside me. Nonsense. I really thought there was a big reveal coming up for this character. The only reveal we got was that he was actually nobody and weaker than Kylo.There is really nothing left to care about after this movie. I did not know that a trilogy could contain only two movies... The only thing left is that Kylo Ren and the First Order are still alive. But hey! There\\'s a little boy with force and a broom! He was probably heading to his Quidditch game if you ask me. Is he who I am supposed to care about for the next movie?The comedy also ruins the movie. Filmakers got to stop. Not all movies have to be action comedies. I am tired of the Avengers because of this exact reason, they are all the same. There is no serious movie anymore. (Look at the new Jurassic Park trailer per example, comedy again, this will suck). Star Wars movies were light si-fi movies. Now, this was like Guardians of the Galaxy 3 or Star Trek - Far, far away.I am a Huge fan of JJ Abrams work, but unfortunately (I am sorry JJ), I won\\'t be going to the theatre to see the third one. This is about Disney an there way of handling the Star Wars franchise. In my opinion, you are ruining the Star Wars spirit.I can\\'t see how this trilogy can be saved now...',\n",
       " 'I was totally baffled during the movie and when I walked out of the theater, had become lost of thought and empty of any emotion - perhaps because I was in a state of shock. I won\\'t regurgitate the many valid negative points that previous reviews have already discussed. They are all valid and should be up-voted every single instance. I just want to comment on how utterly disgraceful it was for the handling of four main characters:1) The writing was careless for Luke\\'s character and his fate. Even Mark Hamill himself disagreed with Rian Johnson about Luke\\'s character and fate, which did not end well for long-time SW fans of the greatest Jedi! In this movie, what we get is an old grumpy Luke, not the spunky fighter Luke who took on baddies, blew up a Death Star, learned the force, and brought down the baddest Dark Jedi/Sith Lord of them all. Granted, he\\'s not young anymore. He\\'s been stuck on a desolate planet for years. He has every right to be grumpy because that\\'s what happens with age. We get it. Instead, the Luke Skywalker in Johnson\\'s adaptation of a beloved series is no more than a jaded, self-preserving, pessimist. C\\'mon! Does every old hero have to go down this road? It was perfect for Wolverine in Logan, but it is not in this movie! It would have been much better if we see Luke with every last bit of Jedi force, leading the last remnants of the Rebellion away from the grips of destruction, then breaking into Episode IX with some questions to be answered. Instead, we were left with yet another Jedi biting the dust knowing that we\\'ll see him again in spirit. Wow, how great was that? We can all feel wonderful now that his spirit lives on. Give me a break! He could have taken on Kylo just fine given what was shown of his powers and fighting skills in a few scenes . And why oh why did he have to fall down when he had already shown Rey who was still the boss? Luke, you were shamefully disrespected by this director.2) Rey\\'s Jedi force and training were poorly developed. She came to Luke and went through some very superficial training. Luke didn\\'t have her doing any physical training, there was no time spent on teaching fighting skills or how to control her light saber. There wasn\\'t even a \"control your anger\" type of training that Luke went through in TESB. She simply had it all endowed coming in to Ach-to. If that\\'s the case, then why the hell did she even need Luke? The writing failed miserably with her development as THE last Jedi. While Daisy Ridley did well with her part as an actress, it was the writing that failed her.3) Snoke\\'s fate...need I say more? The most powerful bad guy in the universe got killed! We didn\\'t get to learn about his vast knowledge about the Jedi, their origin, and how he turned Kylo. All we know is that Kylo is still angry...dating back to SWTFA (and unfortunately Han Solo was on the receiving end of that anger). Did I mention that Kylo is still angry? Angry at his dad, at his uncle, at his mother - three pillars of the SW saga. That\\'s still all we know.4) Leia. OMG, Johnson gave her floating powers. This is no disrespect to Carrie Fisher. She did a fantastic job as usual. But Leia now has powers unbeknownst to us.',\n",
       " 'The Last Jedi is one giant cinematographic anticlimax. Each sequence had a twist for the sake of a twist. Each time, the chosen twist was always the lesser of the interesting possibilities the resolution could offer. Each scene had a build up that lead to an anticlimax.Examples:1) Set-Up: Luke gets his blue light saber back. The biggest buildup at the end of The Force Awakens. Two years in the wait to see what Luke is going to do.Anticlimax: Luke throws the light saber away over his head in a slapstick manner.2) Set-up: Is Admiral Holdo a traitor?Anticlimax: Apparently she\\'s not, she just wanted to hide her plan (of saving The Resistance) from everybody without any apparent reason, creating forced conflict.3) Set-up: DJ explains the war economy to Finn and Rose and shows that the weapon dealers sell weapons to both The First Order AND The Resistance.Anticlimax: Finn and Rose ignore it completely and pretend this discussion never happened.4) Set-up: We finally meet Snoke, the new biggest Dark Side villain of the galaxy. Who is he?Anticlimax: He\\'s nobody, Snoke is killed off in the most anticlimactic and convenient way possible; and this in the middle of the movie!5) Set-up: Rey is finally getting the answer of who her parents are.Anticlimax: She is a nobody. Her drunk parents sold her to Unkar Plutt when she was a child. They then died and were buried somewhere on Jakku in a mass grave.6) Set-up: The big climactic build-up of the battle on Crait where Luke walks towards The walkers of The First Order. The music builds and Luke is ready to do some serious force-s***.Anticlimax: Luke was using a projection of himself, Force-broadcasting it from Ahch-To to leave some time for The Resistence to escape. This drained his energy and killed him apparently.The Last Jedi felt like making love to the woman of your dreams, and right before you come she stops you, pushes you away, and tells you to leave for not apparent reason. You are just dumbstruck thinking \"What!?\"The Last Jedi is a mix between Return of The Jedi and the prequels. It had the potential of becoming \"something truly special\", but like the prequels, all the decisions that were made were the least interesting and in some cases the most ridicule ones. For example: The whole crowd started to lough in mockery when Superwoman Princess Leia flew through space... Casting A-list actors like Benicio Del Toro for small roles is another example of a weird choices.The rhythm was off. Wen the subplot started about Finn and Rose going to Canto Bight, the movie started to drag. Then, when the Crait battle started, everything was rushed. All the interesting questions The Force Awakens asked were answered in a rush.The Last Jedi is a ridicule movie, a 2h32minutes long awkward an weird cinematographic experience.',\n",
       " 'DO NOT READ MY REVIEW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE SPOILERSThis review is a result of episode 8 as a stand alone and not toward a possible 9 (where Disney could reveal Kylo was a liar and the reason why he told Rey if she knew what he saw when he touched her hand, would cause her to turn to his side, was because she would turn dark knowing Kylo killed her father) In the same way episode 6 not 5 revealed Luke and Leia to be siblings.From the moment Poe made fun of \"General Hugs\" and talked about his mom I knew this movie was going to be a POS. Didn\\'t realize Star Wars was on the same comical caliber as The Marvel Cinematic Universe which is based off of comics. After re-watching Episode 1-6 and seeing younglings killed I noticed a severe inconsistency with this universe as of late. I feel the comedy aspect could have been picked up in spin offs, not the main movies. Why does every movie HAVE to have an even amount of comedy nowadays. The Dark Knight didn\\'t require comedy to be an amazing film. Poe had several people killed with his asinine plans and ideas, and we are supposed to look at him like he is some amazing leader ready to take over for Leia? REALLY!? How can anyone think this story is coherent.I love how Rey has never had a teacher or been trained in Kung Fu but some how she has mastered every technique. Since when has a martial arts student suddenly been able to master and perform flawless techniques without a teacher or training? Humans in Star Wars have NEVER done this and neither in real life.This is the reason why people were frustrated with E7. It is terrible writing to start off a character needing no development. Heck even Leia tells Rey they don\\'t need anything else after the resistance is destroyed. NO ****, especially when you have written a character to be so perfect.We come to segment of the movie where Poe agrees that Rose and Finn should go off and find this codebreaker. This entire portion of the movie was to illustrate to the audience that maybe the resistance isn\\'t all good and maybe the empire isn\\'t all bad. At the end of this little section of the story we find out that Finns efforts were all in vain JUST like episode 7, where he goes to rescue the perfect character who doesnt need rescuing. Disney, why would you allow one of your main characters(a minority figure), to be portrayed as useless in 2 films in a row. I love Boyega and you let Rian Johnson destroy his character in the worst way. Which leads into my next tantrum.Finn not performing the most courageous act in history, sacrifice. I know everyone else felt it as Finn was about to collide with the battering ram cannon, that swelling in the throat, and the tears starting to form as finally his character does something meaningful. To only have it ruined by Rose with her line that \"We won\\'t win by destroying the things we hate; we win by saving the things we love.\" OH REALLY??? well that is trumped by the comment Luke makes about war just beginning... last time I checked wars were won by ruthless tactics not by handing out flowers. At one point Luke sees Rey leave and goes to burn the sacred Jedi texts to have Yoda assist with some lightning. Luke turns around and verifies with Yoda that it is time for the Jedi to end where Yoda nods and tells Luke yes. OH REALLY??? That is why Luke on Crait tells Kylo that he will not be the last Jedi? WTF were you thinking Rian Johnson? This script is far less coherent than the last turd I watched, Bedeviled.The acting, sound effects, visuals, music(oh the lovely, amazing music), and costumes were beautiful and praise worthy and with the failure of the script I firmly believe everyone did thier part except Rian Johnson. I love the cast and almost everyone who worked on the film even poor Kelly Tran, but Rian you should feel ashamed.',\n",
       " 'I never thought I\\'d be saying this, but I have never been this conflicted with a Star Wars movie plot in my life. I want to go through the movie one point at a time:Opening scene is probably one of the better space battles we will see in a long time. We notice the desperate escape and sacrifices made by the Resistance. PROBLEM with this part was that you don\\'t know any of the characters- and starting a movie by simply creating sacrifices doesn\\'t give you that emotional connection with the people dying. Either way it was ok enough. So we know Luke went exile on this island, and we would assume (as TRUE fans) that he would learn a thing or two about the origins of the Force. I mean the whole hype around the existance of BOOKS in the universe of Star Wars got everyone excited. But amazingly enough, Luke didn\\'t even seem to have read them all - we literally don\\'t see their signifiance in this whole movie. We remember Luke Skywalker as the beacon of hope after RotJ, but in this movie he seems like a completely different person. I would assume even after loosing his first generation of Jedis he would try to persuade himself to restart, but noooo he DOESNT - he has given up. Luke hardly teaches Rey anything about the Force. We see few lessons, but nowhere near how Yoda taught Luke. This in my opinion was a sad moment! Yet no one really understands why Rey is so competent with the usage of her force abilities. Rey\\'s parentage thrown down the drain. Kylo reveals that her parents sold her on Jakku for drinking money.. I still feel like we will see more to this particular plot in Episode 9.... (HOPEFULLY!)Snoke... man oh man, what have you done Disney? After the Force Awakens, we are left with so many questions regarding this being.. who is Snoke, how does he hold so much knowledge of the Force, what is his connection with the Old republic or the era of the Empire? NOTHING answered in this movie, and on top of this (please God help me with this one) he is killed! There is no revelation about his origins. Just a simple bad guy who was born out of nowhere and wanted to destroy the Jedi and take over the Universe... I mean COME ON, such a stupid way to go.Finn and his girlfriend scenes are such a waste of time. You feel like the planet they travel in order to find a codebreaker is a scene from a Harry Potter movie. I am conflicted with how long they made that scene.. so unecessary. I can say a whole lot more about this particular bit, but I\\'d like you to see this movie and cry about how bad it was made.Poe was fantastic actor in this movie. I love his enthusiasm and he truly lifts the movie with his comedy, bravery, and sense of justice. Princess Leia (RIP dear princess) - seems to be tired in this movie. I\\'ll go straight to the important scene: at one stage some tie bombers destroy her command bridge and she is seen blown into space. Suddenly she wakes up (while being frozen to death) with the use of her Force abilities and flies back into the ship... We have seen some new abilities of the Force now, this one is a big oneResistance is left with, hmm.... 8-9 people by the end of the movie? At the latter part of the movie the remaining Resistance sends out message across the outer Rim for aid, you would believe that someone would reply in their darkest moment.......... NOPE, no one did. BUT LUKE came out in a spirit form (using Force ability while physically remaining on the Island planet). After a deadly \"fight\" with Kylo Ren, he dissapears amd returns to his own body. There he watches the sunset and becomes one with the Force, in other words he DIES. Rey can sense this and so can Leia. With this particular scene we have learned that Luke truly has learned more epic usage of the Force. The part that gets me pissed: does teleporting your own spirit to another planet result in your own death?... nothing about this gets answered. You just see him use ONE ability and poof = dead. This movie is all about making way for the newer generation and I truly hate the way it is done. Trust me, I love Star Wars and I would love to give the newer generations time to evolve and introduced in the most intelligent way, but this movie just wants to kill off legends.Sorry but in my honest opinion, this is the WORST Star Wars movie ever created.',\n",
       " \"I watched this in the theatre, convinced myself that it was a good movie. A couple of hours after the showing, I sensed there was something not quite right about the movie. Then it was released on bluray, and I gave it another chance. Same thing happens.. I got disappointed once again,. I tried to watch it with the director's opinions and responses (after the mass criticisms from fans) in my mind, but still something doesn't feel right about the movie. I read most of the reviews here on imdb, and I have to say I agree with most of the people here that rated it low, as their opinions made sense. The funny thing is that a lot of the reviewers here on imdb that rated the movie high, do not state the actual reasons why they think its good. Probably because there is no way to defend the illogical points of the movie, other than that the director tried to go a total different route of what fans expected of the storyline. When you get over your head and try to be too creative with the storyline, this is what happens..plotholes all over the place. And I believe the people who liked the movie, might have overanalyzed it and the director's vision. In reality I do not think he intended such a deep meaning with the storyline, most of it could be coincidence. And his later explanations of intended deep meanings of the storyline might just be based on what other people overanalyzed after watching the movie. I mean, if it was that good and respected storyline from the beginning, Mark Hamill wouldn't have expressed such negative opinions during the productions. You can almost see the man bursting in agony in various interviews, but obviously he cannot speak too freely for some reason. I do hope episode 9 will redeem the damages that have been done..sigh..\",\n",

       " 'Warning: This review contains significant spoilers.After the excellent Rogue One and the very positive reviews that this movie received, I was hopeful that it would be outstanding. However, I left the theater with a feeling of enormous disappointment. Let me start with the positive aspects of the movie, though. Technically, it is a masterpiece: the special effects are fantastic. Visually, it is a stunning recreation and advancement of the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV-VI). Most of the actors do a good job and the soundtrack is great, too. The space battles are extremely well made -- probably the best I\\'ve seen in any movie so far.However, all of these positive aspects cannot save the movie from its poor plot, misplaced humor, and the fact that it simply does not feel like an authentic continuation of the existing Star Wars universe. Obviously, the last point in particular is subjective, but below I will provide detailed reasons for my judgment.In general, the plot is not believable, tries to achieve too much, and delivers too little at the same time. It is not credible because the entire story feels forced. The uninterrupted hour-long hunt for the Resistance ships (which is a very thin and weak main story line) seems like an artificial way to create tensions. It is full of gaps and developments that are not believable. On the one hand you have the technologically vastly superior First Order forces which are able to follow the Resistance fleet through light speed (something that, according to the characters in the movie, was not even possible previously). On the other hand, they are not able to get any closer to them when in normal speed. Also, it is not believable that an explosion that destroys the entire bridge of a ship and kills everyone on it, leaves Leia physically mostly unharmed (not a Jedi trick, because the Jedi can definitely be harmed physically). Furthermore, the fact that the one person they absolutely need for their plan (the so-called \"Code Breaker\") is conveniently close to the location of the chase just appears to be too big a coincidence. Similarly, the presence of a comparatively close old rebel base is not very credible either. Finally, Supreme Leader Snoke, who appears to be a mastermind, does not notice the light saber next to him turning (I mean, come on)...One of the biggest problems with the plot is that the tensions created are resolved much too quickly and in an anticlimactic fashion. Supreme Leader Snoke, who we barely know and who remains completely mysterious, is taken out of the movie after approximately five minutes of conversation without any big fight. He turns out to merely be a placeholder to fulfill a certain story function. The problem that characters are introduced too fast, remain underdeveloped, and are then removed (even though there is great potential to develop them) -- like Captain Phasma or Rose Tico -- shows that the movie tries to achieve too much but delivers too little. While the plot heavily focuses on Rey, Kylo Ren, and Luke Skywalker, nearly all other characters suffer a fate of under-development and/or quick removal.Also, actors throw around the word \"treason\" and even commit acts of betrayal without any meaningful consequences. For example, Poe Dameron takes over the command of the Resistance in a \"coup d\\'état,\" only to apparently be forgiven shortly afterwards. This is presumably due to the movie\\'s younger target group, but doesn\\'t help its authenticity at all.This leads straight to my second major concern: Episode VIII simply is not an authentic continuation of the existing Star Wars universe. The development of characters and the main story was much more believable in the old Expanded Universe that is no longer part of the official canon. Just compare the development of Luke Skywalker\\'s personality in the old Expanded Universe, as a guardian of new Republic and heir to the Jedi Order, to his completely new personality in Episode VIII (where he runs away from everything and tries to destroy the legacy of the Jedi). Considering that throughout Episode VI Luke does not give up the hope of turning the evil overlord Vader (who he knows to be his father) into a good person again and in light of his success at doing this, it is also not credible at all that he would even consider killing his nephew -- Kylo Ren -- in his sleep. It just doesn\\'t make any sense given Luke\\'s previous character development.As pointed out above, Snoke\\'s appearance and development is also more of a joke. Not to mention Kylo Ren: with his childish attitude he simply cannot serve as a credible bad guy (and especially not Supreme Leader). The entire First Order is a cartoonish version of the Empire. This is not Star Wars anymore. Moreover, the casino scene and the entire side plot with Finn and Rose also did not match the atmosphere and world design of any previous Star Wars movie. The casino looked more like Las Vegas than anything I\\'ve seen in the Star Wars universe so far.Finally, the humor used in the movie often feels misplaced. The film seriously starts with a \"prank phone call\" from Poe Dameron to the general of the First Order. This reminded me of Bart Simpson\\'s calls to Moe\\'s bar and just feels completely wrong as the opening scene. The First Order commander is fooled too easily and his behavior and attitudes remind me more of a teenager than of a high-ranking imperial (First Order) officer. This is again presumably due to the movie\\'s younger target group.Some jokes are pretty good and made me laugh, but their frequency is so high that it simply doesn\\'t feel like we can take most characters seriously anymore. That may be the goal of the creators of the movie -- to produce something more light-hearted -- but, as I said above, this simply is not an authentic continuation of the existing Star Wars universe.Overall, it is pretty clear to me that the movie seeks the broadest possible audience. With stunning special effects, great space battle action, lots of light-hearted humor, and a more cartoonish First Order it wants to turn everyone into Star Wars fans. However, by doing this, it breaks with previous movies of the saga and ultimately has enormous potential to disappoint existing fans. By going maximally mainstream (more than Star Wars was ever before), the movie might be successful at making money, but it\\'s ever harder to distinguish Star Wars in a meaningful way from any other recent SciFi film or even the latest super hero movies. Despite its strengths, the weaknesses -- especially the bad plot and not credible character development -- make it mediocre overall. If this movie would not have the label \"Star Wars\" on it, most people would probably not care to see it. It likely would be forgotten within a few years. With the label Star Wars on it, despite all of its shortcomings, it will probably be an enormous (financial) success.',\n",

I think some of the characters are great - particularly Ren and Rey, but the script and plot are just very poor..The middle finger to the fans, particularly in the treatment of the characters they chose to bring back, was entirely unnecessary and jarring for many, I think.I haven't felt compelled to write a review on this site before, but I loved star wars.

You know that incredibly significant and poignant moment at the end of TFA as Rey hands the lightsabre to Luke?

       " '\"The Last Jedi\" was by far the worst Star Wars movie that has entered the series. The actors themselves are great, but it is the story that has completely ruined the direction of the Star Wars franchise. There may be some spoilers ahead so if you have yet to see the movie please do not read further.To start, one of the biggest issues with the new Star Wars movies are the excessive amount of puns and comedic entertainment that have now been added to the series. Star Wars is not a Marvel movie and is NOT intended to be a comedy. The Last Jedi adds too much unnecessary humor that takes away from the seriousness that is Star Wars.This film is filled with unnecessary scenes and plot holes that will leave you scratching your head by the end. The best example of this is seeing the humanizing moment when Kylo Ren decides not to fire on the bridge of the spaceship where his mother (Leia) was. Leia still ends up getting blasted out into space from the other tie-fighters and then uses her force power to pull herself back into safety. I\\'m sorry but A) Leia has never shown a glimpse of power like this so how are you going to introduce this now and B) What was the point of the bridge blowing up if she was just going to survive anyway? Again, another frustrating waste of time with no explanation or answers. Another major fault by The Last Jedi is the handling of the unanswered questions we all had from \"The Force Awakens\" such as, who is Snoke and who are Rey\\'s parents? We never learn who Snoke is or how he ever came in contact with Ben Solo or how he was able to manipulate Ben to the dark side. With the image of Snoke being a major villain in The Force Awakens you think he would have had a larger role rather than to be killed off halfway through the movie with no explanation of his origins. The ladder follows with the question of Rey\\'s parents, who are deemed \"nobodies\" who left their daughter on a planet without a care in the world. Although this could turn out to be false in future movies the fact that we are left with this as the outcome is anticlimactic and very disappointing.Another thing I have realized that is wrong with the new movies compared to the old is that they are trying to focus on so many supporting characters rather than the core group. The original Star Wars movies still has some of the most iconic supporting characters in cinema today because of their impact while they were on screen, not because they had to create an individual story for each and every character introduced into the Star Wars world. The Last Jedi continues this poor tactic by trying to have a story for Rey, Luke, Ben (Kylo), Finn, Leia, Poe, Rose, Gen. Hux, Phasma, etc. Another thing to note is that Phasma had another pointless role in this film same as during The Force Awakens and just feels forced into the movies at this point.There was so much potential in The Last Jedi but the poor execution of the story really made the movie a dud not to mention trying to make the movie a mix of \"Return of the Jedi\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" The connection between Ben and Rey was interesting and could have been expanded on more as well as the history between Ben and Luke (now knowing the details of their conflict and the perspective of each individual in the scenario). By far my biggest peeve of the movie is when Yoda shows up as a ghost to speak with Luke. Why would Yoda be the one to show up when Luke had a bigger connection with Obi-Wan, or even his own father (Anakin) for that matter considering Obi-Wan and Anakin faced a similar scenario when Anakin slipped to the dark side (same as Ben Solo). Just another example of poor story execution. They essentially took everything that made Star Wars what it is today and threw it all out the window and left us with a mess of a movie with no plot or direction. Again, this is no reflection on the cast, all of them did a great job executing their roles, but the writing was really some of the worst we\\'ve seen in a long time.I left the theater with no excitement or feeling of \"what\\'s next\" and overall was disappointed that they took something so great and have turned it into garbage. This movie seems like the end of the \"Star Wars\" we all grew up with and loved.If I had to describe my overall experience for The Last Jedi in one word it would be, disappointed.',\n",
       " 'The film makers did the right thing by releasing a smart trailer that did not give hardly any of the story away, however I was left unsatisfied and there were some plot twists that completely destroy the rest of the potential star wars cinematic universe. Most of the movie is a missed opportunity.I will get straight to the point and cover the things I liked and the things that I disliked.Liked1. Mark Hamill, he is and will always be fantastic as Luke Skywaker his performance was great.2. Snoke was an interesting character and formidable bad guy, he would and should have kicked serious ass in the next star wars movie!!!3. The battle at the end.4. Chewie.Disliked1. Too much comedy perhaps. The new order was a joke and it seemed like they tried too hard to make every scene a funny one with all First Order characters acting like complete morons, and the rebels stunning each other like juveniles being given a tazer.2. Politically hidden messages in the movie. - Anti Capitalist tone for the people / creatures in the casino. Was that alien picking up coins a reference to Trump? And the horses smashing through the casino knocking over rich people (who by the way sell weapons in the galaxy) really? It\\'s that unobvious? I could see it a mile away.3. Snoke taken out so easily.....I mean c\\'mon Kylo Ren will now be a raving lunatic for the last episode and does not have any dimension to his character besides yelling like a nut case.4. The middle of the movie dragged on and was so boring. A ship following another ship for the whole movie does not add anything new to the star wars lore.5. No lighsaber duels??? even at the end wtf? instead they just fight ninjas.6. Leia blasting Poe and the other commander (Dern) repeatedly calling him a flyboy??? what is that???? that\\'s not star wars, that\\'s a bad attempt at hipster comedy which failed. Looks like DERN thought she was in top gun 2.7. Leia is blasted into the vacuum of space and is still alive. Then uses force pull to save herself. That\\'s just so stupid!8. Luke skywaker....force projecting himself, then fainting to death???? Um what???9. Captain Phasma is just cannon fodder and a huge waste.10. The sub plot where they are looking for that lock smith guy is horrible and cheesy, he ends up being a boring character that is again thrown away and wasted.11. A Rebel Capital ship has 18 hours of shield power and can sustain constant cannon fire, but a dreadnought star destroyer has NO shields and can be successfully attacked by one X-Wing and a handful of bombers?12. Poe\\'s failed mutiny was an absolute joke. How did he get the other squad leaders to point their guns at the officers? and with no consequence to them?13. Rey\\'s parents to be hyped only to turn out to be quote - \"filthy merchants\" WHAT?14. OH Look! A convenient abandoned planet, that happens to have a well stocked, hidden rebel base in it right there when they need it. LOL, gosh a 3 year old kid could think of a better story with a better plot.There are touching moments when Luke reunites with Chewie, Leia and R2D2. But nothing touching throughout the whole film with any of the new characters. There is just no emotion there worth mentioning, except Kylos crazy behaviour and outbursts.Many questions are unanswered, like what was Snokes back story? Why is Yoda happy to burn the jedi tree? Where are the knights of ren? Who will train Rey if Luke is dead / gone? Where can they go to conclude the saga in a satisfying way from this point? The whole thing is a huge mess. Force Awakens was so much better and that says a lot.The movie ran over 150mins and was an unsatisfactory bore-fest. It\\'s like they want to destroy everything in all past start wars films and turn the franchise into a space comedy. Anything serious about the franchise they have sought to destroy. Sorry that was already done a million times better in Spaceballs. Sorry I really wanted this to be great but it failed on so many levels. The plot of the movie is summed up as, Rey wanting Luke to train her and the First Order following a rebel ship. This movie is best described as a mess akin to the mind of Kylo Ren.3 out of 10.',\n",

You spend days preparing the food, then as you plate up you pour two buckets of salt on top of everything. Your wonderful well made food ruined under a mountain of salt. This is exactly what the director did in the Last Jedi, he destroyed it. It was overlong, far too conscious of itself with crude plot twists and no love for the characters. It was as if an alien had landed on earth and never seen the other films and just made it in an afternoon. The words Last are very meaningful, it's the last time I will go to a Star Wars film, the Last time I will care about a star wars film and the last time any fan will have hope of seeing a film fans deserve.

       " \"...but certainly not bankruptcy for Disney, seeing how they treat Star Wars only as a cash cow. I had big hopes for Star Wars when Disney had announced this triology including the participation of the reccuring cast. Similar to the Force Awakens, the story in Last Jedi is disappointing and weak (to be fair, compared to Force Awakens a bit less weak, due to some unexpected story-twists), the new characters are still not interesting but rather onedimensional and the old characters are used in a very unsatisfying way. There are many elements in these movies, which don't feel they belong in the Star Wars universe - including all those modern, misplaced jokes - which might fit in well with Marvel-movies.In my opinion this movie wasn't written by people who really care or know a lot about Star Wars, but solely by the influence of producers, sponsors, marketers and political ideologies. As a teenager I read many of the well written Star Wars novels, which had fantastic stories and use of Star Wars worlds and figures - it's a pity that none of this creativity made it into these Disney movies.At least Disney gave us Gareth Edwards' Rogue One. Albeit its shallow story, it was a movie which looked and felt like Star Wars. Thanks for that.\",\n",

And has so many flaws I cannot possibly list them all.They managed to gut just about everything that made the original trilogy great, more interested in adding whatever they can merchandise, instead of a coherent movie.They dole out force powers like it is candy, the once so mysterious force is everywhere it seems, no longer a hardwon ability that you need to work for. Last Jedi? Heck,everyones a Jedi!

       " \"I rarely write a review but I feel I NEED to do it this time. I just watched The Last Jedi in 3D on a laser projector and the picture quality was top notch. At the beginning you can clearly see that the 3D effects in this film were going to be awesome. The ships in the opening scene were very detailed in a way I've never seen before in a 3D film.But sadly I can't hide my disappointment. Where the Force Awakens introduced us with new characters and thus a lot of questions, The Last Jedi doesn't answer them. In fact I have even more questions now than before. It is also a bit of a slow movie, it takes some time before it really starts going.I'm not going to describe every scene, just a few thoughts I have. We can all guess who the Last Jedi really is going to be, but it's a Jedi who's training is probably the most incomplete. Feeling some rocks, reaching out to the Force (and yes that part was actually funny) going to a cave which again doesn't give any answers. What were they trying to do when she stood in front of that mirror like wall ??? Luke, Lea and Kylo Ren's characters were on par, no big surprises there, aside from what happens to Lea when the ships bridge gets bombed ... Nah, I can live with that scene albeit somewhat extreme for her character.What really makes or brakes this film is the faith of a main character which was introduced in the Force Awakens, Supreme Leader Snoke. Now I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, but I'm the kind of fan that didn't read the comics nor did I see the animated series. I know a bit of the background but that's it. Still I consider myself a fan and I'm sure many of you didn't read the comics or haven't seen the animated series either, just as I haven't.So as far as I know Snoke is a new character one which is portraied with great strength, one who would even surpass Darth Sidious. I was hoping that the Last Jedi would tell us more about his origins, was he in the prequels ? Has he been hiding in the shadows ? How did he encounter Kylo Ren ? Etc ... Allas no answers here ... not a single thing is said about who he is and where he comes from but you can see how strong he is with the Force when he's trying to get answers out of Rey. Skipping some dialogue here ... Rey is being held down by Snoke and orders Kylo Ren to finish her, whilst at the same time YOU CAN CLEARLY hear his dialogue about how he can feel what's going on in Kylo Ren's mind, how he KNOWS what's going to happen and at THAT very SAME time Kylo Ren SIMPLY turns Rey her lightsaber (which Snoke took from her and was resting on his armchair) ignites it and Snoke is being cut in half ??? Did he not see this coming ??? This a character which kept fans curious for the past 2 years and he DIES in such an unbelievable and stupid CHEAP way my jaw LITERALLY dropped to the floor !!! This scene makes or brakes it for me ... and it was the latter.From that point on I kinda lost interest in the story and all I could think of was why ??? WHY RYAN JOHNSON ?? WHY ???And when you think of the story as a whole it's basically an escape the bad guys movie. Finn and (forgot) are going to Canto something to find a codebreaker. They get locked up in jail and of all places that's where they find him ... Sigh. Later on it was apparently a trap and this codebreaker delivered them to the First Order but we don't see anything story wise how this trip was even relevant, they could have just stayed on the ship to begin with and went to Crait straight away along with the others. But then again that would have shortened the movie by half an hour or so at least.I have to say the people who made the trailer really did a hell of a job getting people all excited for the latest Star Wars instalment but it simply doesn't deliver, at least not to me.So many questions still, is Snoke really dead ? Why is there nothing said about the Knights of Ren who were clearly seen in the Force Awakens ? The everlasting question about Rey's parents, simply answered by Kylo Ren was a bit disappointing too, but will there still be a twist ? So many many questions still ...\",\n",

I say this because I know a lot of people who discredit reviewers who disliked the movie because \"the only reason you didn\\'t like the film is because your fan theories were ruined.\" While this may apply to some people, it does not apply to me.That being said: This movie is pretty bad.Back in 2015 I saw The Force Awakens and felt very underwhelmed, \"This is what they are doing with Star Wars? A page by page retelling of episode IV?\" So I was hoping for the next movie to be more of its own thing, which, fortunately, it is. The Last Jedi (for the most part) is its own unique premise and while it has chunks from Episode VI thrown into it and a few elements from Episode V, but the movie as a whole feels like its very own idea.The main issues with this film fall into four different categories that I think most people can agree with are the core issues with the film.1. Bad Pacing2. Big Plot Holes3. Incoherent Theming4. Not Understanding the Star Wars Universe1. Bad Pacing:This film is long. About 30-45 minutes too long. The movie tries to juggle one too many plot threads at the same time and probably should\\'ve scrapped the Canto Bight plot altogether to reduce its run-time and to make a much more satisfying film.The mistake with Canto Bight is actually an odd one that I haven\\'t any other recent films do. In movies, the main goal is to move the plot forward. Character do actions to make stuff happen, but with The Last Jedi the whole Canto Bight arc goes two steps forward and then two steps back so you end up right where you started. Finn and Rose go on a Plan B mission to help save their fleet, they find a hacker, go to disable the enemy tracking device, get caught, and then learn that their mission was pointless the whole time and they go back to Plan A. It is just filler... 30-45 minutes worth of filler.To make matter worse for this side-plot, the filler isn\\'t even that good. I know some people have taken great offense to how \"anti-capitalist\" the Canto Bight story arc was, and while it obviously does have a bit of that going on I don\\'t think it is really that bad. The main issue is Rose and Finn\\'s morals seem a bit mixed up where they decide to free racing animals (that look a bit like The Last Guardian) and don\\'t decide to free the actual slaves. It\\'s a bit odd that they stop to try and \"help people\" but it comes across as rather redundant.This naturally brings us to the next issue...2. Plot Holes:This movie has a one glaring plot hole which connects to the pacing issues: Why didn\\'t Holdo tell her crew what her plan was? There is no logical explanation for why she didn\\'t inform anyone as to what her plan was and only left everyone to think that they were on a suicide mission. Some people have defended this plot point by saying, \"Po was demoted so she didn\\'t need to tell him.\" Yes, but he was demoted to Captain... that\\'s still a high-ranking position. Also, we can clearly see that no one else knows of the plan and the rest of the crew seem to be shaking in their boots. If Holdo had simply whispered to him the plan, there would be: No mutiny, No Canto Bight, and about one hour less movie. The fact that such a large chunk of this movie revolves around such an obvious and glaring plot hole is rather astounding. Did no one notice this when writing the film?There are many other mini plot-holes, but those tie into the Star Wars lore so I will bring those up later.Moving on...3. Incoherent Theming:This movie doesn\\'t really know what it is trying to say, and there is one scene that best sums up this issue and it is the scene where Yoda and Luke are talking to each other. Luke wants to destroy the ancient Jedi books because he is mad at the arrogance of the Jedi (granted, that\\'s true, but they aren\\'t as bad as the Sith who are trying to murder everyone) and Yoda actually aids him in doing it via Jedi Ghost lightning powers. A new trick and a bit comical.The issue with this scene is that Yoda says \"real page-turners, are they not?\" basically saying that the books are boring and thus it is okay for them to destroyed. Luke even seems to admit that he hasn\\'t even read them. With this, the movie seems to be saying, \"It is okay to destroy the past if it isn\\'t very interesting or culturally relevant to you at the moment\" which is one of THE STUPIDEST MESSAGES TO PUT INTO A FILM. Destroy historical relics and books because you don\\'t like them or find them boring? You know who does that? Terrorist organizations. Nazis. Corrupt and evil regimes. Also, the movie has clearly established that there is a race of fish-nuns who have dedicated thousands of years of their history to protecting Jedi relics. It is not within Luke\\'s power to choose if they are destroyed or not as he is not the keeper of them. This is the equivalent of someone running into a monastery and burning all the bibles because, \"I was a Christian at one point, but now I\\'m not so I get the right to burn everything here.\".To make matters worse, we then discover that Rey has STOLEN the books which then makes Yoda\\'s speech to Luke irrelevant. So which is it? Is protecting the past important or is it okay to destroy it? You can\\'t have both.This movie is packed with inconsistencies like this so it is very hard to find a clear and consistent message. I understand it is trying to be deep, complex, and a bit gray, but it never really works.4. Not Understanding the Star Wars Universe:A lot of people have ranted about this issue while others have dismissed it as \"well it\\'s just a movie so it doesn\\'t have to make sense\". There is some merit on both sides, but ultimately there are some pretty big inconsistencies in this movie with the rest of the Star Wars franchise.a. No shields: Yes, this sounds rather petty, but the Dreadnought at the beginning of the film was almost completely taken down by an X-Wing... how? Where are its shields? Every other Star Wars movie has made a plot-point about how Star Destroyers and large cruisers have shields (heck, even the main plot of this movie is about a ship losing its shields). The whole intro scene that shows a single pilot taking out a large ship because \"it is flying too close for us to hit\" makes no sense. The whole point of anti-spacecraft turrets is to destroy ships nearby and the whole point of shields is to make sure ships can\\'t get that close and to also negate damage. This scene feels ridiculous when every movie has clearly established this point.b. Hyperspace-Ramming: I know the scene is very beautiful and nice to look at it, but it causes a ton of issues in the Star Wars Universe. The issue isn\\'t so much about being able to drive a ship into another ship as a last resort (that makes sense) the main issue is its effectiveness level. This maneuver is so effective that it manages to destroy Snoke\\'s main ship along with taking out most of his fleet.Here is a simple analogy of what this scene does to the Star Wars universe: Imagine if Spider-Man was in a desperate struggle in a battle against Carnage and the audience thinks he is going to lose. It is very intense, but then all of a sudden Spider-man opens his palms and then vaporizes Carnage with a blast of radioactive energy! Spider-man explains, \"Well of course I\\'ve always had this ability. I was bitten by a radioactive spider, was I not?\" For Spider-man to do this in a film would be incredibly stupid and unsatisfying. He has had this power the entire time throughout all of the movies that can end any battle at any moment, but just has never decided to use it until now? Why hasn\\'t all of his battles revolved around him using this? Why does he ever lose?That is essentially what Hyperspace-Ramming does to Star Wars. It isn\\'t that the concept doesn\\'t make sense, but it is that it is such an overpowered maneuver that all other forms of space combat pale in comparison. There is no reason to be using lasers when you could have hyperspace-ramming blocks, missiles, or heck, Holdo\\'s entire plan from the get-go should\\'ve been to use that maneuver. Why didn\\'t the other cruise ships use that maneuver before they got blasted? See, even within the context of this film, everyone should\\'ve been using hyperspace-ramming at every chance they got. There is no reason not to.c. Rey\\'s Incredible Power Gain: I know a lot of people have called Rey a \"Mary Sue\". For those who don\\'t know, a Mary Sue is a female character (originating from a parody of fan-fictions) who becomes obscenely powerful within the context of the universe with little to no explanation and then meets all of the cast of the said series usually as a mean of the author inserting themselves within the story. Rey is overpowered with seemingly no explanation, but she doesn\\'t seem to be a tool to insert the writer into the narrative and meeting the original Star Wars cast was going to happen regardless of the gender of the protagonist.Still, this movie only takes place within hours or so of the first movie. Rey has had no training, no real force experience, and no real combat training, and by the end of the movie she is moving hundreds of boulders with little to no effort (something that we haven\\'t even seen Yoda do) and taking on a whole armed guard with her light saber skills. To put it simply: She went from no knowledge in the force to becoming more powerful than Yoda in a matter of two days or so. Adding to this frustration is the fact that Kylo Ren who has trained extensively under Luke and Snoke (the two most powerful force users until Rey) for almost all of his life... has almost no skill.Inconclusion: This review was going to be a lot longer, but I hit the IMDb word limit... I was going to bring up \"subverting expectations\"...',\n",

Then \"Rogue One\" came out, it was alright as well.

We have the main characters WHO JUST DONT DIE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. Disney must return shooting the High School Musical; they have ruined Star Wars, they have ruined the best memory of my childhood. As a Star Wars fan, I could not help myself crying after seeing this movie which is worse than \"the Phantom Menace\". You need to be ashamed.

And even when we think there is some sort of plot - no! We are then told that the light and the dark are fairly interchangeable, that no side is a good side... except when in the end it matters again?Domhnall Gleeson's character is more of a caricature, being thrown about like a rag doll, completely undermining the power of the villainous empire. Leia survives the most ridiculous explosion and exposure to space. Who is Snoke? Who is Rose? Why is every moment of possible tension destroyed by a cheap joke, making this film more like the soulless void of the Marvel franchise or a money-grabbing Disney film?Why can none of the actors act? This film poses so many questions regarding the script, it's plot, and sadly, the industry as a whole.Watching The Last Jedi was like watching an old friend suffer an undignified death.

       " 'I have scrolled through over 100 reviews, and have only seen a SINGLE 5 star review. 95% of reviews are below 3 stars. Surely, something fishy is going on here.

       " 'I was fed the hype, including a number of critic reviews in the mainstream media, and am left wondering if they saw the same film that I\\'ve just watched.Very, very average at best. Little discernable actual plot; just a sequence of set piece action sequences interlinked with pointless chummy, huggy dialogue between characters that I find it hard to care about. It\\'s cinema for the twitter generation. No actual depth to it at all, just a derivative movie which repeats (and repeats) the genius signals of it\\'s early predecessors without doing anything at all new. What a horrible shame that possibly the most successful movie franchise of all time is reduced to this.ACTINGIt really is coming to something when Mark Hamill is not only the star of a movie but is also depended on to hold the whole thing up. I am coming to the conclusion that Daisy Ridley really doesn\\'t have the talent to do her (key) role justice. Adam Driver actually steps it up a whole gear from the previous movie and was very watchable, but all the other characters basically shout thier lines at each other, clearly conscious of someone holding a stopwatch off screen.SCRIPTStar Wars scripts have always been legendarily wooden, but under Disney the bar has been lowered to a level that 6 year olds would find condescending. Let me provide an example :Back in the old days (say) a Tie fighter would be attacking the falcon. Old dialogue was something along the lines of :(Skywalker and Solo struggle to shoot fighter, Skywalker eventually bags it)LUKE : \"See I got one\"SOLO : \"OK kid, don\\'t get cocky\"In the new world that same scene is scripted :(Finn and Rey struggle to shoot fighter)REY : \"Shoot that fighter!\"FINN : \"I\\'m going to shoot it\"REY : \"If you don\\'t shoot it now we\\'ll all be destroyed\"FINN : \"OK I\\'m going to shoot it\"(FINN Actually shoots fighter, massive explosion on screen)FINN : \"WOOT! WHOA! Did you see that? I shot it\"REY : \"Yes I did that was amayyzeeen\"FINN : \"That was fantastic!\"REY : \"Yes you are absolutely amazing\"I think you get my point...Shockingly dreadful, CeeBeebies level scripting that almost had me yearning back to the good old wooden days of Hayden Cristensen wooing Natalie Portman.AND THE DISNEYFICATIONOh boy, here\\'s where Disney should have left it alone. The film unfortunately trots out a small zoo of cute \"Disney\" creatures. From the pointless Llama-like creatures which have been stolen stright out of \"Never Ending Story\" to the little Pingus with big eyes the film starts to resemble one of those dreadful Pixar animal animations which only 5 year olds can bear.I could almost write pages and pages about where this film goes wrong. The film raids the it\\'s own archives for material heavily, refilms it and it\\'s just not as good second time round despite having what appears to be a few $bn of effects thrown at it.Thank you Disney Corp for actually managing to accelerate the ruination of the greatest movie franchise in cinema history. All that remains now is to bring back Jar-Jar Binks in a leading role.',\n",
       " \"I wish I could give this garbage zero stars. And make no mistake, that's exactly what this film is, no matter what the glowing reviews tell you. I would greatly appreciate your time in reading my extensive review so I can tell you exactly why this film makes Star Wars, from here on out, dead to me. As a political scientist, I want to warn that I'll be focusing on criticizing the underlying toxic concepts and agenda that are pervasive in this film, rather than the plethora of other faults that have already been pointed out by reviewers and non-paid off people alike. Yes, the film is bloated; yes, it shares visual and narrative similarities with The Empire Strikes Back; yes, it delivers absolutely no character development; yes, the plot has more glaring holes than Swiss cheese; yes, the humour is completely off and unnecessary; yes, Luke Skywalker is ruined and dies because he ran out of Mana points; yes, Kylo Ren still throws temper tantrums that try to present him as a nuanced, conflicted character but instead fail spectacularly; yes, Rey is a blatant Mary Sue; and yes, everything about this film is pointless and consequently doesn't make sense. And it's 2017: I am no longer impressed with beautiful visuals, the technical spectacle of CGI, and cool explosions. I never cared about it anyway, and now I especially don't because it's a standard of modern filmmaking. So if these are counted among the actual positives of this film, that's just pathetic. But I basically want to do a post-mortem and examine why this film ended up being so thoroughly disappointing and is causing backlash. In my opinion, it's because everyone, from the creators to the viewers, is more concerned about being politically correct than having a thought provoking, engaging story with memorable characters and a good, emotionally involving plot. It's like this new Star Wars trilogy was conceived in the boardroom of a disgustingly lucrative and intrusive media corporation that has the power to shape people's minds, particularly young impressionable ones.

And so is this movie compared to Episode V, even to Episode III in my opinion.*** Spoiler from here on***Before I am going to mention my main issues I have with this movie let me say I had some really good laughs, intended and unintended ones, and the movie was well made, but the story...oh boy.As I read somewhere at least one subplot is totally pointless because it leads nowhere, namely the \"casino plot\" where Benicio del Toro comes in, what a waste of a good actor. I learnt when some sub plot is pointless, you just cut it. Also the internal logic of this sub plot stinks: if that admiral with the purple hair just would have explained their plan to Poe all would have gone well, very well to be exact. So we have a whole pointless sub plot because some leader didn\\'t want to explain their plan. When this lady assumed command and looked clueless I felt: Where is Captain Kirk when you need him?The other main issue I have is this:Killing off your vain villain is o.k., but not in the damn middle of the trilogy! Here is the strength of the original trilogy when it comes to the main villain: Although the emperor is mentioned in ANH, you have the impression Vader is main bad guy, only in TESB you see the emperor for the first time as a hologram and in ROTJ for real. In this sense TFA feels like part 2 of a trilogy and TLJ as part 3, but it just is supposed to be the 2nd part. What good is that?Kudos to Disney, you have manouvered yourself in an excellent position with that. So the whole storyline of TFA and TLJ feels like two people were working on it and Rian Johnson just didn\\'t like JJ\\'s creation of Snoke so he kills him off in a most silly way, one of the unintended laughs.As sad as the passing of Carrie Fisher was, why not kill Leia? Do some reshoots, but no, Luke has to go. Really well done. The only explanation I have is that they did a lot of reshoots in order to kill off Snoke and then set of a new trilogy with that kid in the end....here we go again.....I never thought I\\'d say this, but I really miss Mr. Lucas\\' talent for constructing and telling storys.EDIT: Almost 48hrs later after I watched the movie I am still feeling disappointed. The analytical part of me still says, the movie isn\\'t that bad so my 6 stars will stay, but the Star Wars Fan boy heart is so sad. I still don\\'t know if I can joyfully rewatch the original episodes because I know what is going to happen to Luke later.The only explanation I have is this: George Lucas sold to Disney to get revenge on all these prequel haters so he can say: \"See that big pyle of Micky Mouse poodoo you can get?\"',\n",

And who is the mysterious Snoke?Major spoiler here!. Rey just turns out to be no one, with no connection to anyone. That\\'s literally the explanation in the film. So much for weeks of analysing her Force dream in TFA. Snoke - no explanation of who he is, whats his connection to Palapatine, How he witnessing the Clone wars. Nothing.

Possibly it might get better on subsequent viewings a la \"Crystal Skull\" and your expectations are low. The mythology is not there, so I doubt it will be watched too many times. The prequels have silliness and bad acting, but strip that away the three film arc of Anakin to the Dark Side and Palpatine to power is genuinely fascinating and is what draws you in to repeated viewings. That is missing from the new sequels. We will never get to see George Lucas vision for these sequels. That is a true shame as I fully believe he would have done a much better job. These sequels are a Disney / Marvel churn out. Big on CGI but no story, spat out for the popcorn masses, whoc can\\'t focus on a long term story.

       " 'When I first saw it, deep down I knew I was disappointed but I kept telling myself \"its so good!\" I was in denial.After actually thinking about this movie critically, this has unfortunately become, in my eyes, the lowest of all ten Star Wars films. My reasoning can be broken down into five simple reasons:1) Johnson takes the elements that Abrams sowed in Episode 7 and instead of reaping a harvest, disregards the themes and characters completely and does what he wants to do. Kylo\\'s obsession with Vader - gone, mystery surrounding Rey - does\\'t matter, intrigue of Snoke - literally rips in half, Legend of Luke Skywalker - throws in the trash.2) Johnson directs Mark Hamill to instead of playing Luke Skywalker as Lucas created to be, to instead just be basically play himself.The character of Luke is unrecognizable. Even tragedy like he faced does not completely change his persona and personality.3) Johnson Continues Abrams awful idea of disregarding what a Jedi truly is, how the force works, and the respect that is due a lightsaber. This sequel trilogy is teaching us that becoming a Jedi doesn\\'t take any training, discipline, or much of anything. If you just pick up a lightsaber and start swinging you too can be the most powerful Jedi. (also, go watch the lightsaber scenes again and compare the choreography to I - VI. It is embarrassing.)4) Johnson gives us narratives that do not contribute to the story at all. When you think about it, nothing really happens in The Last Jedi. Rey going to Ahch-to was pointless; Luke\\'s training was not even training. Going to Canto Bight does nothing to help them save the Resistance. Poe going against the leadership of the Resistance is also pointless.5) Gives us nothing to look forward to in Episode 9. With the death of Carrie Fischer, them killing off Luke and Han, we now have no connection to the original Star Wars, which is a huge mistake. A final confrontation between Rey and Kylo has no weight at all because Kylo keeps getting bested by an untrained Rey, Rey\\'s lineage apparently doesn\\'t matter, Snoke is not longer a threat, and honestly, we do not really know why the First Order is after the Resistance, there is very little actual Galactic threat like the Empire or Palpatine.In summation, watching The Last Jedi simply does not feel like watching Star Wars. This movie is bad and Johnson is too prideful to admit it and also disrespectful to the fans for disregarding their feedback. I really want to anticipate 9, but thinking more on 8 makes that very hard.',\n",

Unfortunately unnecessarily because The Last Jedi decided to throw everything into garbage bin.The plot is a complete mess with no conclusions and no point. The choices made by creators were awkward and just plainly STUPID. The movie leads absolutely nowhere leaving you with distaste. You WILL be rolling your eyes. The only answer to the questions prompted by TFA we get is Rey Parents. Have you felt satisfied with the answer? I certainly did not. Still don\\'t know the reason for her power. The training with Luke was a DISASTER. There was no training at all. Breathing exercises don\\'t count. Sorry. Why did Yoda even show up? There was no point at all for this. Why did Rey Jump to this \"Black hole underground place\"? It lead to absolutely NOTHING. The worst but most hilarious subplot was the one when our heroes go to the casino only to get brutally arrested for bad parking. And they still managed to find what they were looking for in the prison by accident. And again it lead to absolutely NOTHING. This part could have been cut out with NO CONSEQUENCES whatsoever. The deaths... Come on. You want to kill someone - kill them. Don\\'t revive them 5 minutes later with \"magic\". If that wasn\\'t bad enough, Luke died from sitting on a rock too much. Probably hemorrhoids. I feel bad for actors who played, this lazily written script, very well . Especially Mark Hamill whose character\\'s got SLAUGHTERED. Finn was useless. He did nothing that mattered the whole movie. The last scene of him speeding towards the Death Star cannon gave me some hope but no, he had to be saved in the name of forced romance.

Characters who had already grown in TFA (Finn, Poe) suddenly regressed for no reason. Major characters (Rey, Kylo, Luke) would make surprising moves without any basis or set-up, for the sake of surprise. In fact a lot of the movie can be said as favoring a \"twist\" happening at the expense of consistent character development. The prequel movies\\' treatment of Anakin\\'s character development was a lot more satisfying, AND that\\'s a generally panned. At least the prequel movies\\' story tried in earnest, TLJ did worst that just phoning it in.As some movies have become acclaimed films over time after an initial bashing by the critics (e.g. Bladerunner), this one I believe will take the opposite direction.Here\\'s hoping JJ fixes everything with IX.',\n",
       " 'It has been a while since I reviewed a film on IMDB. Most of the time, I just enjoy watching them, but this time I just had to say something. I can\\'t guarantee that I\\'ll avoid spoilers, so don\\'t read below the asterisks this if you haven\\'t seen the movie. In a nutshell, I\\'m a lifelong Star Wars fanatic and I do not like this movie. In many ways, I rate this lower than the maligned Prequels. The film was released for purchase well over a month ago, but I will not be buying a copy. In my video library, there is not going to be an \"Episode 8\". There. I said it. I feel better now.Let the spoilers begin.***********I rate this film as 3/10. One star for John Williams\\' soundtrack. One star because it\\'s Carrie Fisher\\'s very last movie. One star because Luke tells Leia toward the end of the movie: No one\\'s ever really gone.\" If it hadn\\'t been for any of these, I\\'d give it 0 stars. Well, actually IMDB requires votes of at least 1 so I\\'d have to find some reason to give it one star.There\\'s something different about this movie and about this series now that Kathleen Kennedy is in charge. She is just fine with allowing the directors total control over the plot and character development of every film. If that means that all continuity with the rest of the series is destroyed, then so be it. At least the \"creative freedom\" wouldn\\'t be bridled. If you were a movie director, could you think of a better job than this? You have complete control to do whatever you want - no rules here. Rian Johnson knew that it wouldn\\'t matter what he did in this movie - even if the fans rejected it, they\\'d all see it dozens of times and the film would make well over a billion dollars world-wide.So he was free to:1) kill off beloved characters,2) destroy Rey\\'s parentage,3) give BB8 special abilities he didn\\'t have in the previous movie,4) introduce brand new paper-thin characters,5) destroy the entire Rebellion and the Jedi,6) re-define the Force,7) burn down the ancient Jedi tree, and 8) add Yoda\\'s stamp of approval on the entire mess.At one point in the movie, Kylo Ren says, \"I\\'ll destroy you (Luke), and her (Rey), and all of it.\" This is just what Rian Johnson set out to do. All of his decisions about what to do with this film point in only one direction: He wanted to bulldoze the franchise so he could start his own trilogy at some point in the future and re-do the entire series. I\\'m going on record right here and right now. I\\'m not seeing any more Star Wars films created, directed, produced, or even influenced by Rian Johnson for the rest of my life.',\n",
       " \"Rian Johnson and Co succeed at ruining both this new trilogy, and the old by totally crapping on old and new characters. Killing off Luke was the biggest mistake, it should not have even been considered after they killed Han. I guess they didn't get the memo that Luke IS Star Wars.Not going to repeat the thousands of other reviews. Movie is just a saga killer.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ll tell ya quickly why The Last Jedi sucks...Aside from the Rey/Kylo \"Force Skype\" which was totally ridiculous. So Luke never got his happy ending, ya see, he struggled SO much - his aunt &amp; uncle were burned alive, his mentor Ben Kenobi is murdered, his hand gets chopped off, his evil father dies. He\\'s had SO much misery, it\\'d be nice to see him 30 yrs later happy, with a wife &amp; a few kids maybe? But no, it was all for nothing. Luke\\'s reward for all those acts of heroism is to die alone on an Island, never getting married, never finding happiness, &amp; not having any cool lightsaber battles.',\n",
       " 'The Last Jedi is an interesting failure, unlike the slick but obvious The Force Awakens - which I guess was a boring success, aiming at an easy target and hitting the bullseye. The more ambitious Episode VIII has intriguing ideas and neat set-pieces, but they are spoiled by serious mistakes.I could go on and on about those.Luke Skywalker has become a bitter hermit haunted by his failures. Considered in a vacuum this characterization has potential, but in the context of the whole saga it just feels wrong. It retroactively damages the original trilogy, which had completed Luke\\'s character arc - much like Han\\'s, and that\\'s why I dreaded the return of the old cast and would have preferred the new films to take place like two hundred years after Return of the Jedi. Still, kudos to Mark Hamill, who is great in this in spite of everything.The hyperspace-ramming moment, for the sake of an admittedly cool visual, opens a whole can of plot holes about the entire saga (why nobody ever did that with the various Death Stars?) and involves Holdo, a character we have no reason to care about; it\\'s like Mon Mothma blowing up the Death Star (if Mon Mothma had the relational skills of Cruella De Vil). This would have been an effective send-off for, say, Leia... or Finn, who has a similar moment actively sabotaged later in the movie.Speaking of Finn\\'s aborted sacrifice, it highlights the movie\\'s garbled handling of themes. So, is sacrificing yourself for the greater good the right choice or not? The Last Jedi gives two opposite answers and frames them both as correct. Or maybe it\\'s the right choice only if you have no romantic interests. Wow, deep.I also don\\'t get what the film is trying to say about the Force. That everyone can be a hero regardless of Force powers? We already knew that (Han, Lando, Chewie...). That you don\\'t need to be an \"official\" Jedi to tap into the Force? We already knew that (Luke in A New Hope, even Chirrut in Rogue One). That *everyone* can use the Force regardless of innate sensitivity? I guess not, or everyone in the galaxy would be waving lightsabers, lifting rocks and being hyper-competent like Rey. Or is it saying that you don\\'t need an important lineage or a famous name to be a Force-using hero? Look, the prequels were mostly a failure, but you don\\'t need to turn them into galactic strawmen. Episodes I-III showed a galaxy chock-full of Jedi of different species; Anakin himself was born a slave! As stupid as Midichlorians were, nobody ever implied the Force was some kind of selective aristocratic privilege.The Canto Bight subplot turns out to be useless in terms of narrative economy, bearing no consequences on the plot.Like many recent blockbusters, this movie is bloated - you could easily cut 20-30 minutes from it. See also the Multiple Climaxes Syndrome: what looks and feels like the final battle is followed by yet another very last act (it reminds me of the clunky structure of Spectre).While The Last Jedi is, to its credit, far more original than The Force Awakens, it does sometimes commit a similar mistake: imitating the original trilogy\\'s narrative beats without any of the underlying logic or deeper emotional meaning. When Luke risked his life to redeem Vader, it was the sacrifice of a son to save his father\\'s soul; when Rey does the same for Kylo, it\\'s unearned and absurd (he is nothing to her other than the guy who kidnapped her, wounded one of her friends and killed another). The character motivation for this baffling choice is some vision of the future, a lazy screenwriting shortcut which was rightfully booed when Lucas employed it in the prequels and isn\\'t any better here.But really, my main issue is TONE. Star Wars has always been a lighthearted adventure, not a parody. There are moments here which could have taken place in a Star Wars spoof like Spaceballs (Poe prank-calling Hux, Finn\\'s brusque awakening, the Porgs annoying Chewie, Luke and the green milk, Finn leaking fluids from his suit, Rose zapping Finn, Snoke and Kylo tossing Hux around like a ragdoll, BB-8 commandeering an AT-ST...). It\\'s like Jar Jar Binks all over again, only not concentrated on a single character but spread over the whole film.Now, you shouldn\\'t approach Star Wars like it\\'s Crime and Punishment... but when you mock your own characters, plot and lore for the sake of a cheap laugh, you undermine any sense of pathos you\\'ve been trying to build.Emblematic of this is Luke\\'s first scene. While I\\'m not a fan of The Force Awakens (although it looks better now in retrospect, at least it got the tone right), its ending was one of the few effective moments: the young apprentice looking for a teacher stands before the legendary master and returns him his paternal weapon. Writer/director Rian Johnson pays it off with a gag. This bathos runs through the movie.5/10',\n",
       " \"Wow - IMDB's has a new FAKE rating system. The true average rating is 4.34. Consider - 33% are 1 star reviews. 53% of all reviews are 1/2/3 stars. So ... HOW exactly is this a 7.3 movie? Oh yeah ... bribes! Gee thanks for that. My review? Simple: One of the worst movies ... ever. Forget the details. They are well documented elsewhere. Clearly, the franchise doesn't care, hasn't in a long time and never will again. Thank goodness we didn't go to the theater and waited for it to hit streaming - and gosh that didn't take long LOL.

       " \"I cannot comprehend what went through the director or the writer's minds when they pushed out this pathetic attempt of a Star Wars movie. To think they erased all those Star Wars novels to insert this garbage into the franchise as the new canon is baffling.Let's start off with some observations (SPOILERS):Finn and Rose's day out. What a terrible segment that lead to absolutely nothing. It was poorly played out and all that screen time amounted to no results and in the end was basically filler for the movie.Space bombers...I just can't wrap my head around this concept. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in space.Snoke's death. Anti-climatic and poorly delivered. This was suppose to be the new big baddie behind the scenes and his death was used for a silly scene to generate a few chuckles from the audience.Kylo Ren once again disappoints. He could not defeat Snoke's bodyguards despite being touted and advertised as a powerful Sith rivaling Vader himself. Vader would have mopped the floor with those guards. Kylo also failed to read Luke's astral projection while engaging it in combat. How in the bloody hell were you the top Jedi student? Who else was at that academy? Jar Jar Jr?Rey's lineage. This one remains to be seen but the movie establishes that her parents are junkers and are of no importance. If this is true than the build up in TFA was all for nothing and this is yet again poor story telling.Leia's Fate. The fact that she can apparently force pull herself back into the ship after being shot out into ice cold zero gravity space for more than a minute is just ridiculous. She should have either exploded into chunks during the explosion OR instantly froze into solid ice. Vice Admiral Holdo. This awful character was pushed onto the audience in place of Leia and General Ackbar. She was insufferable and completely incompetent as a leader. Why would you lie about your strategy against the pursuing ships? You cause a mutiny out of poor leadership then they try to cram her down our throats as a brave hero who sacrifices herself to save the Resistance. Nobody cared. In fact people applauded when she died because we knew we would never have to sit through her character again.\",\n",
       " \"I waited until I watched at home again about six months after being disappointed in the theater hoping maybe I missed something. Maybe I was tired that night or something. Maybe my expectations were to high. Nope. The movie was just the worst Star Wars ever made. TFA was good not great but got ride of the bad aftertaste of the prequels. The movies were back on the right trace. Rogue One was incredible. Maybe the best Star Wars movies ever except Empire. Then this movie. There are thousands of reviews that will go into more depth than me but here's my main reasons why I think it's the worst. 1) Forced Humor and No Chemistry.Not since Padme and Anakin has there been little chemistry in a Star Wars film. The humor seemed forced. You really don't seem to care about anyone. Even beloved characters like Admiral Ackbar are killed in such a way you're like oh well.2). The CasinosNo need for this. Did nothing for the story. The CGI and production seemed straight out of the prequels. This whole sequence seems like something that would have been on the extras dvd of The Phantom Menace. 3). Plot HolesSo many to list. Just read other reviews on here. This director just didn't seem to care about all the movies and stories before this one. 4). Destroyed So Many CharactersSo many of our favorites and even new ones are served up for us horribly. Either being weak, dumb, or just killed this time. Luke and Leia. Finn. Ackbar. Snoke.

Fin and Rose go to a high end casino - Just like James Bond. Liea flies like she was Mary Poppins.All of this would not necessarily make it a bad movie if the story was great but its not even good - Way too many plot holes and inconsistencies. At this point I honestly I would be more excited about Spaceballs 2 than I am Episode IX. One star is generous !!',\n",
       " \"The New Order has the Republic, now the Rebellion, on the run. General Leia Organa's small resistance force has been discovered. Their only hope is Force-newbie Rey finding hermit-like Luke Skywalker and persuading him to pass on his Jedi knowledge to a new generation.I must start by saying that I hate togive spoilers, but it is difficult to assess this film fairly without doing so to some extent.The Force Awakens, episode VII, was a huge commercial success, but was - fairly - accused of revisiting the story from A New Hope. Does episode VIII avoid that accusation? Up to a point. You don't have to look too closely to see echoes of The Empire Strikes Back, though.The Force Awakens successfully passed the torch to a new generation, but left many unanswered questions. The Last Jedi opens with a terrific action set-piece - dammit, Poe IS a hotshot flyboy! - but then we want to have some questions answered. Who is Rey and why is she connected to the Force? Why did Kylo Ren turn rogue? Who is Snoke? How did his connection to the Force arise? Why does he have those hideous scars? How did he get his hooks into Ren? What does Finn do next?This film addresses NONE of these questions except in the most unsatisfactory way.It provides spectacular visuals which, of course, we expect. It gives us a host of cute aliens, robots, and tech generally. It gives us some humour. This is unusual for a Star Wars film. It would be welcome if it were not generally so misplaced. It does not help the film to have the evil General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) portrayed as a slapstick bumbling buffoon.The Last Jedi has two egregious faults. The first is narrative sloppiness. This is especially noticeable in the casino heist/Benicio del Toro sequence which is completely inconsequential and irrelevant. It should never have been part of the film. It goes nowhere, adds nothing and, with minimal rewriting, could have been cut. The film would still have run over two hours, but a good deal less than its bloated 153 minutes. The film is not well-paced.The second flaw is a wilful re-writing of Luke Skywalker's character. Luke has always been a hero, even when he was a callow, inexperienced youth. To revise him into someone who turns his back on doing the Right Thing, notwithstanding the provocation, is a betrayal of the audience. We have invested much in this character, over many years, and this is not playing fair with us.Oh, and while we're at it, John Boyega must be hugely disappointed: Finn was hardly in it.In short, the narrative does not flow well, the story is underwhelming, we don't get the answers we wanted to questions, and characters are inconsistent with earlier versions. And, as a result, The Last Jedi is a disappointment.\",\n",

       " 'George Lucas is truly a genius. After seeing The Last Jedi I will never again mock Lucas\\' vision for Star Wars. I will watch the prequel trilogy with a new appreciation. I won\\'t roll my eyes at the lame humor, or laugh at the horrible acting, or mock the bad CGI and Jar Jar Binks (okay, I\\'ll probably still do that). The Last Jedi has done what I believed to be impossible. It made me long for another George Lucas Star Wars movie. Right now I would give almost anything for his version of episodes 7,8, and 9. I can\\'t help but think this was George Lucas\\' hope from the start. He somehow knew the only way to win back the fans (and make a quick buck) was to have someone else ruin Star Wars worse than he ever did. And that is exactly what happened. Now George will be remembered as the hero, and Disney will be remembered as the villain who gave us The Last Jedi, aka the worst Star Wars movie of the bunch (and there are some clunkers in that bunch). On a more serious note, TLJ is truly a dreadful movie. It sucks out any of the magic that was left over from The Force Awakens, and left me feeling indifferent about Episode IX, which is something I never thought I could feel about a Star Wars movie. When the Force Awakens came out I did not enjoy it as much as other people seemed to, mainly because I hated the way the movie destroyed everything won in the original trilogy. No one else I talked to seemed to notice this because the movie WAS fun, and exciting, and it was Star Wars again dammit, who cares if (spoilers) Han Solo was killed by his own son, and Luke was off on some island doing nothing? Star Wars was back! Well, it\\'s back again, but this time the movie lacks all of the fun, humor, and mystery of The Force Awakens and it is hard not to notice how atrocious this movie treats the Star Wars lore, mythology, and most especially Luke Skywalker\\'s character. Staying true to it\\'s predecessor, TLJ continues destroying the original trilogy one scene at a time. Luke might as well be a new character, Chewie and R2 are in about four scenes total, the force is used in ways that are questionable at best, laughable at worst, and I\\'m left wishing Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill never agreed to be in these movies. But TLJ does not just ruin everything about the original trilogy, it also ruins everything good about The Force Awakens. Instead of building off of the foundation the first movie created, Rian Johnson (who is somehow getting his own Star Wars trilogy after this mess) decided to take a bulldozer to it. If you had any questions after watching TFA, you will probably be disappointed by something in TLJ. Legitimate plot points have been glossed over, or literally tossed aside as if Disney were mocking their own audience\\'s anticipation. This is mostly done for the sake of shock value, and while there was at least one scene that was genuinely surprising, it just rings hollow because this movie gives us no reason to care about anything. Where is the heart? The plot of the movie is nonexistent, and the \"new trio\" we all liked in TFA is split up for 90% of the film. Finn\\'s character, who had such promise, is wasted in a pointless story-line and paired with an unnecessary character. Poe, who seems more and more one dimensional, is pitted against another unnecessary character (Are you seeing a pattern here?). Even Rey does little more than chase Luke around on an island for most of the movie. Rian Johnson seems much more interested in Kylo Ren than any of the heroes. He does his best to make Kylo sympathetic, but it\\'s too little too late. The scenes between him and Rey come across more comedic than anything else, and in the end the story-line turns out to be just another wasted opportunity to explore something interesting. But you would think there must be something interesting in a 2.5 hour movie, right? Wrong. The movie could have been under an hour once all of the pointless scenes were cut. Why this movie was aloud to be so long is beyond me.To sum this all up, I can no longer feel anything but fear when I think about all of the future Star Wars movies Disney is making, and I really wish George Lucas never sold his creation. In a heartbeat I would go back to the days when all we complained about was who shot first, and why the \\'yub nub\\' ewok song was taken out and Hayden Christensen was put in. Most of all I want to go back to a time when The Last Jedi movie did not exist.',\n",
       " \"I know the movie genre is a lot about personal preference, but Star Wars is a little more than that. It is not only a great sequence with a lot of story and emotions behind it, but a very uniquely build world. With that mentioned, when Episode I came out there was some disappointment in the core fans, because they've projected their version of what Star Wars should be in the final product. I LOVED Star Wars I, it was a very subtle simple introduction to the world in a different way. Yeah, Darth Maul could be a little more under the highlight, but other than that we got really good product. Now what happen with Episode XII? It was recycled, cheap reproduction of Star Wars. They tried to satisfy the core fans with the copycat plot of the previous episodes, BUT they failed to deliver the very essence of Star Wars, its storyline connection. You've just killed (literally) the characters of the old Star Wars, like it's some kind of mocking to the whole world, replaced with the new ones that are completely disconnected from the sequence. If you put episode I to VI in a row, you get that touching family story full of struggle, fantasy, pain &amp; joy. What happens when you add the next VII and VIII? Just super disconnected emotional disaster. Disney could acquire lucasarts, 20th Century Fox, but with their arrogant attitude towards the history of a production, they'll fall as every empire did before them, no matter how big they get. If you feel the same as I do, please think twice before you support them. And research what the creators/actors think themselves about the whole situation.Happy holidays,\",\n",

That year for Christmas I got a STAR WARS bed spread for my room. I\\'ve been a true fan for literally as long as I can remember. My wife and I took our 17 year old son to the movie last night -opening night. Afterward, walking to the truck, the question was asked, \"What did I you think of the movie?\" Our son says, \"That was one of the greatest movies ever!\" He goes on about the fighting and everything. He thought it was too long and a little boring at first but really loved it overall. I tried to be nice and said it was my least favorite STAR WARS movie ever.

       " 'Let us all be brutally honest,Something has gone incredibly wrong in Hollywood. Somehow, somewhere along the way, the people involved with these major studios lost the ability to create something truly magical and timeless. The talented people who used to be involved in these ventures ranging from cinematographers to screenwriters have almost all been replaced, the equipment, techniques and artisanry lost to history. Meanwhile, the new generation seem to be largely comprised of mediocre, though well meaning novices - so desperately undermined by the marketing forces behind these big studio projects that now almost dominate all the best franchises. I suspect that what made Star Wars great to begin with, was not simply the storytelling recipe that these newcomers exhaustively attempt to recreate, but in my humble opinion, exactly what made any literary classic great - liberated imagination. George Lucas had far more time to polish his ideas to become the amazing characters, story arcs and concepts used in the original movies. To be fair, the Prequels also had some of the same features, but suffered immensely from the emergence of inauthentic CGI, loss of talent and a far more intensive production schedule. Now these big universes that we love so much have been incorporated into the industrial mass production scheme we see everywhere else from music to washing machines. All that considered, one of the dominating feelings I\\'m left with after having seen this movie twice in the cinema, is that I feel sorry for Rian Johnson, JJ Abrams and the other people on the project. Clearly they never wanted this movie to turn out so horribly - but creating a coherent and universally loved experience in this day and age is almost impossible.That said, I don\\'t even see the need to dig into any of the specific deficiencies in the movies, which previous reviewers have discussed at length - and rarely require anything special to recognize. I would hope that in the desperate attempt to rationalize or excuse this massive failure, that the studio and central people involved with avoid blaming the moviegoers or fans. There is a idea circulating that somehow we\\'ve built up this expectation in the shape of fan theories and so on that make it impossible to judge the movie fairly. I\\'ll be happy to concede that this could play a role for some people, but overall, the premise is unacceptable and pure nonsense. People know a good story when they hear/see one. This much has not changed in the decades that have passed. Ironically, part of my argument is undermined by the standalone movie \"Rogue One\" - I\\'m extremely curious to know how this movie managed to come so much closer to authenticity than the Saga movies have. I suspect some of it is pure luck and far lower expectations from the industrial side.',\n",
       " 'I am baffled by how much The Last Jedi hates what should be its strongest fans.As others have said, this movie doesn\\'t go the way you think it would, but not in any sort of interesting way. I, like many, came into this move with questions I\\'d been wondering about for at least 2 years. Who are Rey\\'s parents? Who is supreme leader Snoke? Why is he so powerful? How was Ben Solo seduced to the dark? Last we saw of Luke he was on an island. What the blazes is he doing there?The Last Jedi could have answered these questions in many ways. It could\\'ve answered them \"safely,\" giving what we expect. It could\\'ve answered them in interesting ways, propelling the story forward in unexpected directions. The movie\\'s answer?\"It doesn\\'t matter. Oh, you thought it did? You assumed after all this build up and mystery there\\'d be some sort of payoff? Well screw you. I need a paycheck.\"Other reviews have gone into the uninspired story, the barebones plot, and the surprisingly non-funny attempts at humor. I\\'ll spare you my takes on those and focus on one aspect I hold dearly in my heart: Luke Skywalker.Luke Skywalker is my favorite character in any fictional story, ever. And this movie does all it can to completely ignore his character arc from the original trilogy. If you love Luke Skywalker, I mean really love his character and who he is, you won\\'t like this movie.I\\'ve loved Star Wars for as long as I can remember, but, unfortunately, this is not the Star Wars I was looking for.',\n",
       " '\"Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. A magical power holding together good and evil, the dark side and the light. Crazy thing is... it\\'s true. All of it\".So said Han Solo in The Force Awakens. It turns out, though, that Disney *do* think it\\'s all a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. The only thing they believe in is making money. Lots of it. And boy, there\\'s lots to be made by selling little penguin lookalikes so cute they turn even poor Chewbacca into a life long vegan. Why worry about the story, the script, the acting, the plot, you know, the stuff that makes a movie really great and enjoyable to watch, when you can milk a generation of newly minted fans for soft toys for the rest of their pre-pubescent lives?And the sad part is that I know all that and I still suffered two and half hours of this awful film in utter disbelief and didn\\'t ask for my money back after it was over. I suspect we have all been turned to the dark side of the Force and enslaved by the Empire - except in our galaxy they go by the more innocent sounding name \\'Disney\\'.I won\\'t bother with the details of why this movie was so bad. The atrocious dialog, the cringe-worthy and ill-timed attempts at humor, the gaping plot holes, and the wooden acting could all have been forgiven if the movie had not been turned into a caricature of itself. But the director and writer Rian Johnson managed to achieve this feat by poking fun at all of Star Wars characters and themes and stripping them of any deep philosophical, moral, or intellectual meaning. Meet the new Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck: Luke Skywalker and Supreme Leader Snoke.It\\'s a good thing Han Solo died in the previous installment of this declining franchise. After seeing this one, he may have started to once again question his belief in the Force.',\n",
       " 'Sometimes there is the situation, when you want to say or do something, but not knowing why, you do the opposite. The same must have been with the Disney executives, who read the script of The Last Jedi by Ryan Johnson. They wanted to say something like \"What?!?!\". Instedy they uttered: \"Excellent! Let\\'s do this!\". Here is how The Last Jedi buried the Star Wars franchice once and for all.The first problem with the Force Awakens, was that it was basically the copy of the New Hope. However, the passage to the world which looked and felt like Star Wars should always do, compensated for most of the drawbacks of that movie. Today, if you feared that The Last Jedi would rip off The Emprire Strikes Back the same way The Force Awakens did with the New Hope, fear no more. It turns out it is now possible to cram two movies (namely The Empire Strikes Back AND Return of the Jedi) into one at the same time! The key scenes are meticulously moved into this picture (though in different, problably random, sequence). Who needs the whole new trilogy, anyway? The main problem with The Last Jedi is the story. It is totally unbalanced, starting from the first minutes. Of course, there are a couple of paths we have to follow, but their interconnection just does not work. There is no tension, no one will be sitting at the edge of the seat, waiting for the next scene. Also, although the movie seems to the the Star Wars episode, sometimes it turns to be something more like Harry Potter...The second problem is tone. The general idea was to make this episode a darker one (just like The Empire Strikes Back). Unfortunately, there are also some funny scenes (quite good ones, I must admit), which are put here and there. As the result, we have no idea - should we be scared, worried or amused? Sure, this is the space advanture movie for kids, but some content for adults used to be smuggled as well. Now, there is just a mess we have no idea how to react to.Unfortunately, some characters playing even prominent roles are treated cruelly and despite their previous achievements. For example, Luke (who at least speaks now) is not the Jedi master, who defied the Satan himself, saved his father and brought the peace to the galaxy. Instead, we will see a grumpy old man, who complaints a lot, is afraid of many things and behaves like anyone but the Jedi knight we knew from the original trilogy. General Hux, who was the ambitious supreme commander of the First Order forces, now is just the incompetent clown, often facing comical consequences of his own failures. It is interesting, anyway, how the First Order managed to pose a threat to anyone, having such a set of stupid commanders with the lack of imagination, surprised by the Resistance during every encounter. Captain Phasma, who, allegedly, was so popular among fans, is in the movie for a very short amount of time, though this time she speaks a couple of sentences more than before (nothing special, but still...). I bet everyone will be disappointed by this character after watching the episode...The old cast is passable but the new actors are not that good. Music is nothing special and I believe it will be difficult to remember the score at all. Visual effects are good, but new ships\\' designs are not that impressive. In general, everything that would work is \"borrowed\" from the original trilogy. All new ideas are questionable at best.If anyone is hoping to find answers to the most pressing questions about this new Star Wars universe (like, who is Snoke, what is the relation between the Empire and the First Order), You can continue waiting. The Last Jedi brings no answers to any questions as such.To sum up, while The Force Awakens was the positive surprise, giving hope that Disney has any idea how to push the Star Wars cart, The Last Jedi takes such hopes away. The movie is weird, some characters do things that should not be done by them, the pacing is wrong, there is no required atmosphere. It seems that indeed the best thing they could do was to repeat the older story once again. Everytime they try to throw something original in, they fail miserably. I am afraid, this is the end of the Star Wars universe. There is nothing more to be said in this topic. Now, esteemed executives from Disney, please switch to the production of Tron 3...',\n",

There are no character arcs either (save for, maybe, Kylo's). The only 'grand idea' they had was to kill our old heroes one by one and destroy everything they stood for. To destroy everything we loved about Star Wars.Did they at least replace them with something worthy? Well, since from Finn to Phasma, from Maz to Hux, from Snoke to the new characters (Rose, Admiral Holdo, or the Codebreaker) everybody proves to be nothing but filler (even more so than in the already dreadful TFA), the answer is a definite No.Stick to Rogue One.

Both in Imax 3D and I went in having not seen any spoilers and avoided any reviews and trailers in order to keep my experience fresh and innocent.The opening thirty minutes is the most tedious opening to a Star Wars film since the days of the prequels, with absolutely no emotional attachment to the overlong action on screen. Bad start to a very bad movie.As the film goes on it becomes apparent that the script is not going to be good. Some of the dialogue is the worst in Star Wars history, and there are moments when characters are talking to each other that make you want to throw the person next to you at the screen.Characters are stuffed into this episode like there's some kind of mad emergency to feature as many as possible for merchandising reasons.The comedy made me angry too with a couple of lines and a cheeky wink at C3PO making me wince and worry for the future of Star Wars.Luke Skywalker's character has basically been totally disrespected and ruined in this film too. There's no way he would do what he does and feel how he feels in this film, but the director of this movie has no worries about this or any other part of the Star Wars universe he tramples all over.There are pointless relationships (Fin in particular gets involved in an unnecessary romance that leaves the viewers cold)There is one shot where Luke delivers the line about things not turning out the way you think it will that is so badly out of focussed it makes your head hurt.The musical score is as slow as this overlong movie too adding nothing of value.I just don't know what else to say other than this is a total absolute mess of a movie that tramples all over Star Wars, makes it worse, disrespects the characters, and offers the worst dialogue not just in Star Wars history but quite possibly the worst script and dialogues of all movies in 2017.What happens to Leah will have you wanting our money back (if you don't walk out at this point). It's that bad. It's so shockingly bad. The sequence with Leah in space will get you so angry your skin starts to boil.And even worse the acting is bad. Daisy Ridley delivers some of the dialogue as though she's appearing in The Room with Tommy Wiseau, and Domhall Gleeson giving the worst Star Wars performance since Jar Jar Binks was strutting his stuff.Imagine Transformers meets Pacific Rim with the acting of The Room and the storyline to beat all mad storylines and you'll have an idea of the vacuous tepid dull overlong tedious steaming pile of odorous cinema you'll see in a long long time.I went straight back in to watch it again to make sure it wasn't just me missing the whole point of this film.

       " 'I\\'m a woman who has loved Star Wars for more than two decades. I created this account because I want to talk about how much I hate The Last Jedi. It\\'s been 9 months since I first saw the movie and I am just as angry about it now as I was in December 2017. This movie has killed part of my love of Star Wars, which means it has killed a part of me. This movie is a criminal. My issues with the film:1. TLJ is calculated to enrage Star Wars fans.The people responsible for this movie claim to love Star Wars, but TLJ is a hate letter to Star Wars and to everyone who loves it. The contempt for the material and its fans comes across clearly in myriad ways (lightsaber toss over the shoulder, killing Ackbar offscreen, breaking the lightsaber, burning up the original Jedi temple, Luke badmouthing the Jedi, etc), but never more clearly than in the way Luke Skywalker was portrayed. His character is the most beloved and representative of Star Wars other than Darth Vader. When you choose to make him gross and ridiculous (breastfeeding scene?) and transform him from a noble hero into a cowardly, lying, treacherous weirdo (attempted murder of Leia\\'s son? Rude and scary hobo?) you know that the intention is to offend and to destroy a legacy. A competent writer and someone who actually liked the material would have found a way to raise up the new characters and make them shine without having to destroy, literally and figuratively, the OT heroes. 2. TLJ is poorly written and poorly edited. Rian Johnson wrote an incoherent 4 hour long story and tried to tell it in 2.5 hours. The result is a movie that feels disjointed and poorly paced. The plot is nonsense, especially the Canto Bight sequence, the Poe and Holdo drama, Rey\\'s entire arc, Snoke\\'s demise. The movie has been praised for delivering twist after twist, but the story goes nowhere and it\\'s shock for the sake of shock, with no real meaning. The movie is an exercise in nihilism. Nothing means anything. The characterizations are poorly handled, especially Rey. She is one of the worst heroines I have ever seen. None of her decisions make sense, and it\\'s unclear what is driving her character forward or why we should even care about her in the first place. She earns nothing, works for nothing, she is special \"just because\" but also she is nobody. OK?? The stunt with her parentage is completely ridiculous, and another instance of trolling the audience. Luke\\'s arc is fine within TLJ, but makes zero sense if you consider the OT; it\\'s like he\\'s a new character that Rian Johnson made up on the spot. Poe is elevated to consequence to the detriment of Finn why?? The big thing about TLJ is supposed to be the women. So many women, binders and binders full of women, but they are all poorly characterized: incompetent Holdo, lame and sappy Rose, boring and unrelatable Rey, annoying Maz, poorly acted Connix who can\\'t think for herself, sexually harassed Space Cow and even Leia with the ridiculous Leia Poppins BS and giving Poe\\'s mutinous ways a pass because he\\'s cute. Gross. The tone of the movie is a mess. This is not Marvel, stop trying to make it Marvel with the dumb comebacks. Star Wars is all about bad puns and lame humor, that\\'s part of what makes it so great. The humor in TLJ is like a wink and nudge to the audience that just cheapens the experience and makes it unequivocally 2017 as opposed to timeless. The ill-timing of these so called witticisms undercuts the gravity of moments that would have otherwise been beautiful (\"No one comes from nowhere---oh yeah, that\\'s pretty much nowhere.\" *eye roll*)3. TLJ is a vehicle for certain individuals to clumsily promote their political agenda. I have no problem with Star Wars being used to proselytize (George Lucas did it) so long as the message is conveyed in a sophisticated way that is transcendental and conveys a larger, universal message. \"Capitalism is BAD and rich people are BAD\" is dumb and hypocritical coming from Disney. \"MEN ARE BAD AND WAMEN ARE GOOD\" is an even dumber message. The way this agenda is being defended has caused division and toxicity among the fandom like never before. Are there good things about this movie? Yes. Some of the visuals are stunning, Kylo Ren is fabulous, the Rey and Kylo Ren dynamic is poppin and the \"hand sex\" scene and Praetorian guard fight is stunning. These few things allowed me to watch the movie more than once so I could confirm how much I absolutely hate everything else about it. Honestly Kylo Ren and what will happen with him and Rey is the only reason I\\'m going to bother watching episode IX. I don\\'t care about anything else at this point, and once Kylo\\'s arc is done if these people are still at the helm of Star Wars I am no longer going to take part in it. Going by the approach to Luke Skywalker, to previous Star Wars movies, to the lore, to the mystique of Star Wars and to a portion of its fanbase, I am pretty sure that The Last Jedi was a deliberate troll on the part of Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy, seeking to \"revitalize\" the franchise and get a conversation going by diving straight into the current culture wars, dragging the franchise along. But they miscalculated BIG TIME and they are paying for it now. They can try to discredit fans and gaslight people all they want--TLJ is generally despised by all except newer fans who don\\'t care about \"old Star Wars\" and what it represents. But those new fans aren\\'t the lifeblood holding the franchise afloat. When you go after your consumer base predictably the money will stop pouring in. And money is really the bottom line for Disney. Let\\'s see how this plays out, but I\\'m willing to bet that the RJ trilogy won\\'t be happening.

At Rey\\'s level in this movie, pretty much starting with her first scene in the movie, she could basically one shot Vader... SERIOUSLY!!!!!

The person who greenlighted this, the system that produced this, the studio that made this, the so-called director that 'directed' this and most of all all the suck-up paid for and bought critics. This is the film that woke me up to how the critics and professional reviewers are all shills. It violates everything we know about Star Wars as far as creativity, Jedi rules, behavior of the characters and atmosphere goes. The director has done an immaculate job trolling the fans on social media and destroying Star Wars. Perhaps the actors are reacting to a poor script. I wish all involved would just go away. Its become so toxic with the politics involved. I only wish something I like had not become a battle ground for this kind of nonsense. I wanted to add my review, however, to warn fellow Star Wars fans that this is not Star Wars. Moreover, say good-bye to a saga that endured in the hearts of people for 40 years, but will not anymore.Take your Disney jokes, one-liners, jabs and wisecracks, and silly politics, they are a bad fit for star wars.Personally I am done with these films, reviewers, Disney and Star Wars.

Here\\'s what bugs me the most but I\\'ll miss out the stuff that\\'s been mentioned lots of times.1. Admiral Ackbar given a poor death. Why didn\\'t he fly the suicide run at The Supremacy instead of a purple haired Laura Dern. 2. When Rey is placed in a hold by the Pretorian guard his other hand should stab her as he\\'s holding two blades but they just edited his hand out. 3. The overuse of the word hope. Take a shot every time they say hope. Actually don\\'t as you\\'ll be dead in 30 minutes. 4. The suicide run. For forty years not one person has thought \"hey let\\'s get a droid to fly an obsolete ship into a star destroyer at light speed\"?5. Rian Johnson setting imperial walkers on white planet against rebels in speeders but having a rebel soldier essentially pick the surface to identity it as salt. \"See it\\'s salt, I\\'m not really ripping off Empire cos salt is obviously not snow\".6. The entire Canto Night scene. \"Finn let\\'s free these big eared horse things but the slave kids not so much\".7. The biggest gripe for me. The opening scene. First why fire on the base when they can see they\\'re evacuating. Just destroy the capital ships and they have no where to go. Also, when Poe is doing his one man miracle mission against the dreadnought, and the first order realise what he\\'s doing, they send a hand full of fighter\\'s. Look at the scene. There are a trio of star destroyers behind the dreadnought. According to Star Wars lore, there are 72 fighters stationed on ONE star destroyer. Send the lot, rebellion over. Then we get the whole miles per gallon script. Why don\\'t the first order do a small hyperspace jump and get ahead of the rebels and attack head on. Now I know this film has it\\'s fans and anyone that disliked it is labelled a hater, but it really is poor. There are no big reveals answering questions set up in the force awakens. There are just let downs and they are plentiful. It feels like the last jedi was Rian Johnson\\'s homework and he didn\\'t do it until the night before and he winged it on the day. Why bother bringing back Luke to have him be a miserable old codger? To close as I could go on all day, Luke Skywalker refused to kill Darth Vader as he knew there was some good in him. Vader slaughtered the Jedi and thousands of others. Ben Solo has a dark dream and Luke\\'s ready to chop that boy down as he sleeps. None of the last jedi makes sense.

TLJ disregarded everything set up in TFA, and had no pre meditation on where episode 3 would go. Horribly incohesive story with more plot holes than Swiss cheese.

The comedy style had a Guardians of the Galaxy sort of feel to it, but it didn't fit in a STARWARS movie.Secondly, there was very little continuity with previous Starwars movies. Suddenly, Jedi can now use the force to project holograms, and can communicate with each other that way instead of just with a voice inside their heads. Also, somehow the insane amount of power that is tied to the Skywalker bloodline is now meaningless, or at the very least a huge contradiction.Which brings me to .. Thirdly, how in hell is ray so powerful? It doesn't make sense. In the previous movie, she bested Kylo Ren literally right after just discovering she had force powers, and with NO TRAINING AT ALL. Now, she manages to get the better of Luke freaking Skywalker ... seriously? Again with NO TRAINING! In the old movies, Luke looks totally pathetic when he was training. Both Yoda and Kenobi were vastly superior with their skills compared to Luke, and it was a little reminiscent in that way of old school kung fu movies. Luke had to gradually progress and EARN his skills. However, in these new movies, there is no reason for Ray to train and no need for her to improve because she is already greater than everyone in the galaxy. She is just right of the box the greatest thing to ever exist. It's stupid!This movie feels like it was written for the spoiled millennial generation only. The generation that wants greatness without actually having to work for it or earn it. The generation that chooses shortcuts over hard work and discipline, every time. IF you're the type of person who cheats on tests, or did steroids as soon as you started working out, you might like this movie. If you're the type of person who doesn't care at all about the continuity with previous movies in the series, and the overuse of comedy where it doesn't fit at all doesn't bother you, then yeah, you might like this pile of filth.P.S. all three of the prequels blow this film out of the water.\",\n",

       " 'I saw this movie many months after it was released and was unaware of how it was received because I wasn\\'t paying attention. I didn\\'t read anything about it on purpose and didn\\'t watch the trailers because I didn\\'t want those to ruin it for me. I am a life-long Star Wars fan, but not one of the hard-core types (SW was my favorite set of movies and I had the toys as a kid, but grew out of it and never got into the comics or games, etc). Then I saw it at a friend\\'s place several months after its release. Almost immediately, the Poe vs Hux scene set the tone for what this movie was to be, and it was not good. This movie had great visuals, but the plot and characters just sucked. I was initially in a state of confusion after watching this. Afterwards, I started looking online and saw a few things: apparently the actress for Rose was being harassed online (?) and how Rian Johnson was lashing out at certain fans (partially to defend her?) and partially due to his arrogance at realizing he made too many mistakes with this movie. Honestly, what I saw of him behaving online was very immature. I saw a pic of him holding a sign saying something like \"your Snoke theory sucks\". The back and forth of it all reminded me of junior high school. RE the Rose character: I thought the character was very annoying, particularly at the end when she ruined Finn\\'s only good potential act in the movie (I liked Finn in TFA, but he was kind of lame in this movie). But, that, in and of itself, would not have ruined this movie entirely (and certainly doesn\\'t justify anyone harassing the actress, obviously). The whole movie, when taken into context with the written statements of RJ after the fact, smells of his hubris. He wanted to make this \"his\" movie and to hell with any continuity. If he wanted to do it this way, then why not just make a goofy, comedy/sci-fi movie on its own without standing on the shoulders (and pissing on) the legend that gave it that perch in the first place? I guess that might also happen now that there are rumors of him getting his own trilogy... wow, talk about rewarding bad behavior. Anyway, I won\\'t go through and document all the cringe worthy moments as there are far too many and others have done a thorough job of that. The main cop-out to me was the way they handled Snoke (and yes, I have read Rian Johnsons rationalizations of this, and no, I didn\\'t have a \"fan theory\"). I am not passionate enough to join the \"get Kathleen Kennedy fired\" movement, but I now no longer care about Star Wars and won\\'t bother seeing Solo or Episode 9- and certainly won\\'t touch RJ\\'s coming spin-off trilogy with a 10-foot pole.Another thing I want to add is to address the way KK, RJ, &amp; JJ Abrams have dismissed any criticism of this film by painting all those who dislike it as racist, sexist white supremacists who fear women. First of all, my 2 sisters and wife also called this movie \"garbage\". Second thing specifically to address JJ Abrams comment about critics fearing strong women: total BS. Alien was probably my second favorite movie series growing up and even into adulthood and you won\\'t find a stronger female (believably written, unlike Rey) character as Ripply out there.

The story, if you can call it that, is pathetic. I feel like I\\'ve seen fanfiction with more thought put into it than this piece of crap. The whole story is virtually just the Resistance is trying to go to a Rebel base on an abandoned planet while trying to shoo off a First Order ship trailing them. That\\'s it.

       " 'Bottom Line: The Last Jedi was a pointless story with pointless character deaths that undermined the Star Wars universe.Maybe Disney knows how to make money and good movies are just not the way. This new trilogy is doing very well for Disney, but is a mashup of recycled clips that completely miss the point of why they were there originally. Middle movies are always difficult, but The Last Jedi was particularly devastating to the Star Wars universe. As a Star Wars fan, I\\'m a little tired of the \"good guys\" being the underdogs and fighting the big evil. These movies would have been much more believable and interesting if the Republic was starting to reestablish itself and the First Order was becoming a credible ISIS like threat. Snoke ended up being a non-player in this new universe, so they should have skipped him completely and had Kylo Ren as a want-to-be emperor instead of a want-to-be Darth Vader.These movies have no discernible theme, so far. The original 6 were about the redemption of Anakin through a prophecy that said he would destroy the Sith, but left out that he would destroy the Jedi and himself in the process (the force needs balance after all). The Jedi were the imbalance and Anakin set the force right by embracing the dark side and destroying them all. These larger themes are forgotten in this new trilogy leaving them hollow with little more to think about than what merchandising will come from them. What is more difficult to grasp is that most of the plot elements dead ended leaving you with the feeling that you wasted all of that precious screen time.One of the greatest tragedies was how R2-D2 was left as a nostalgic prop. In the original 6 R2-D2 was the one who guided the fate of the galaxy by subtle influence on everyone else, and was the only character who knew the whole story from beginning to end. In The Last Jedi he is nothing more than an old robot and his significance was missed completely.A few interesting things that occurred if we view the movie as a series of clips, Force Skyping was an interesting addition to a universe that did not have this type of communication in 1977. The concept of good and evil being a matter of perspective, how arms dealers sold to both sides, and how the Force is bigger than the Jedi were more realistic elements then the black and whiteness of the original view of the world.There are too many ridiculous plot elements to go through here, such as the resistance fleet very slowly getting away for the entire movie, and Rey being upset by Kylo Ren not wearing a shirt as if the destroyed AT-AT remnant she was living under in the desert her entire life as a scavenger had strict fashion protocols.Overall, it\\'s another mish mash of recycled concepts that miss the point.

A purple haired admiral who also serves no purpose, then goes out in a blaze of glory, and we are left asking ourselves \"why did they cast this character? Why did they not use Admiral Ackbar more? and why did they kill him off?9) A cringe worthy performance from Kelly Marie Tran. The character who played her sister, looked much more interesting, but what do they do with her? Same thing they do with every great character, they kill them off to subvert expectations.10) A random cameo from Mary Poppins flying through space (clearly another bad idea)11) Absolutely zero character development and with no overall arch.12) Weak male protagonists.13) Even weaker male antagonists.14) Unbelievable newly invented abilities from the space ships.15) An underwhelming performance from Captain Phasma. Like Snoke in the TFA, Phasma is introduced as a strong antagonist, yet to be under used and killed off because they couldn\\'t be bothered, or RJ just didn\\'t like either of the characters, and decided to write them off.16) Questionable scenes between Rey and Kylo communicating telepathically through Supreme Leader Snokes doing, but after Snokes demise the telepathic connection still continues all by itself between Rey and Kylo.17) A scene filler showing CP30 and a super powered R2-D2. Another quick scene just say \"don\\'t worry, it\\'s still SW\".18) A scene filler with Maz Kanata that was best left on the chopping room floor.19) A strange cameo from Master Yoda with newly invented force abilities. The idea of Yoda making a return was more than welcoming, but it was short lived, and from what we can see is that TLJ is focused more towards the new cast and not the old characters (we get that). They tried to emulate the old mannerisms of Yoda but missed the mark and unfortunately such as Luke\\'s character not enough care was taken, as the perception I got from Yoda in the TLJ, is that he came of as a bizarre yet semi bi-polar joke of a character, and so it felt like a complete gimmick.20) An overly powered lead character with zero Jedi training edges out Jedi Master Jake, I mean Luke Skywalker. Where in TFA she dispatches Kyo Ren comfortably, which should have been a warning sign. Kylo Ren, a guy that\\'s been training in the force his entire life! A guy who had a Jedi Master as his mentor for most of this life! Loses to a young girl. That\\'s like asking a young Ronda Rousey before she had any training, or was a fighter to jump in the octagon with a seasoned veteran like a Brock Lesnar or Randy Couture and expect her to smash them. That is how ridiculous it is, and yet they allowed this happen, it\\'s just mind boggling.21) A weak and dejected Jedi Master that contradicts everything that character has ever been (see Mark Hamill\\'s response, i.e. Jake Skywalker). The opening scene he tosses his light sabre over his shoulder and then drinks green milk from a space alien\\'s teat. Did they just forget TFA even existed?They completely ruined Luke\\'s character, what on earth were they thinking? And Snoke? Who is he? Where did he come from? But more importantly, why did he perish so easily? In an obvious set up that anyone could see coming, but for some reason the baddest being in the galaxy fails to notice it. Even if they explain Snokes backstory in Episode 9, they will never be able to explain his demise to the hands of his pupil Kylo Ren. The best excuse would be \"Snoke was blinded by his own arrogance\", which doesn\\'t stick due to the fact Snoke made it abundantly clear that he can see and feel every move Kylo Ren makes, so... where does one go from here? Bring Snoke back in Episode 9? Say it was all a plan, or that Snoke was a puppet controlled by a higher being? Or just forget Snoke ever existed.Having said all this, if they did the right thing with each and every character, then I wouldn\\'t have a problem with any of them. So, you can\\'t blame the actors as they have a script and they just follow directions.Watching this in the Cinema for the first time, witnessing the way they ended Luke\\'s character, reminded me of the time when I use to work in a Pizza shop in a city, where the back door was adjacent to a dirty alley, often occupied by the homeless, and at that time I witnessed a Heroin addict inject himself with a syringe, to the point where he did the chicken dance before succumbing to his demise, fell over then propped himself up while slumping over in a sitting position reminiscent of Luke\\'s character, crapped his shorts and perished right there and then on the spot. So where does one go from here? The only way they can fix it, is bring Luke Skywalker back in the flesh, because anything less is unacceptable.Furthermore, the poorly and amateurish choreographed light sabre fight in the throne room (Wizard of OZ rip-off) that looked like something drummed up on post production - because it was forgotten in actual production, as it\\'s obvious this wasn\\'t a priority but felt more like a scene filler, and packed with sloppy continuity errors in the editing department, just look up \"Movie Mistake in Star Wars The Last Jedi Explained\" on YouTube).\" And then in the final act during a fire fight, Finn \"slowly\" drags Rose for literally miles back through a sea of lasers, all the way back to the base, and somehow manages to avoid getting obliterated by the AT-AT Walkers and friendly fire, then miraculously appears at the front gate within minutes.This director is a complete amateur (See Ridley Scott\\'s comments), RJ has already gone down in history as the most hated Director of all time in a matter of only 1 year. But RJ isn\\'t all to blame, he\\'s just the scape goat here, the fall guy. RJ is the apprentice, because there is always a master and an apprentice. In this case KK/Disney is the master, and RJ is the apprentice, I\\'m pretty sure we know how this scene plays out, as there are plenty of clips on the internet as examples (depending on your orientation)Whoever green lit this hot mess, is a reminder that people like Jon Peters (Superman Lives, Superman Returns and Man of Steel) are still lurking around in Hollywood and destroying everything in their path just because they are in a position of power, had a rush of blood to their skull and thought this and that would be a great idea. Well, at least we didn\\'t see a giant spider... yet, however in the TFA there was a scene with a Rathtar, which felt out of place.If RJ\\'s intent was to make SW great, well... he failed. It is obvious RJ was a never a fan to begin with, but merely an amateur director looking for some fame at the expense of SW. And like Gillette, it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s good or bad press... at least there\\'s a discussion, and now you are famous for all the wrong reasons, but you are famous none the less.Fast forward a decade from now, TJL will be used in film school under the workshop class, titled \"how not to make a movie\" or \"how to successfully destroy a franchise\". Cannot recommend TLJ to anyone, because really I am finding it difficult to find a reason to. This movie doesn\\'t even belong in the \"so bad it\\'s good\" category either, so it\\'s kind of an enigma. Can you imagine the executives who green lit this, watching this film a year on after its release? Would they sit there with a straight face and say \"Great film\" yeah, I think not.Star Wars - The Last Jedi is quite simply a disaster of the highest magnitude that delivers a kick in the guts to anyone who grew up watching this franchise. But even if you don\\'t treat TLJ as another addition to the SW universe, but rather a standalone film? It is just an example of what happens when you just wing it with a one sided political agenda in mind. Normally bad films have a mistake here or there and you can just forgive and still enjoy it, but this even worse. TLJ is rotten to the core, from start to finish.',\n",

For those rare people who haven't yet seen or experienced Star Wars, do yourselves a favour and watch the original trilogy. It doesn't really matter which edition you watch, but personally I prefer the original formats. Each of the three were spectacular in their own right, and Empire Strikes back is considered by some to be one of the greatest films ever made. Not everyone would agree with me, but many would, that the Last Jedi is both the weakest of all 8 of the saga films (Episode 9 has not yet been released) and that it also does the most damage to both the lore of the Star Wars universe and to the most important legacy character. Many people who saw this film wish they had not. I am one of them.As for direct criticisms of the actual film, there is no shortage of that to be found anywhere. I am in agreement with what the vast majority of those critiques assert: that the script is poorly written, the characters are weak and their actions make no sense, and that it seems to be the product of someone who either totally misunderstands the mythology of Star Wars or who purposefully intended to usurp the lore and legacy of the original trilogy.

The Force Awakens was a decent outing, but just teased us with the Luke Skywalker appearing in the very last scene of the movie. The credits rolled before he even spoke a word. This film picks up from this point exactly.We wait nearly 35 years for this moment only to be let down monumentally. We see his character throw his fathers lightsabre off a cliff, as if to say he does not care of its significance. A metaphor for how this movie does not care for the characters and lore of the previous films in this saga. The characters in the movie actually clumsily state repeatedly how the past must be 'killed' The treatment of Luke's character is bemusing. Mark Hamill himself stated on more than one occasion how he fundamentally disagreed with how the character was written. The writer/director Rian Johnson chose subverting expectations over consistency and good storytelling.The tone of the film is totally messed up - every serious moment is undermined with a bad joke. No-one laughed at this poor jokes at my screening.This movie looks gorgeous, the effects are fantastic, some of the action is great to watch. BUT it disregards how the universe works, the characters do not seem consistent with the previous films, it has very clunky overtly political tones.The plot of this movie is riddled with plot-holes and leaps of logic. Yes, I know this is a Star Wars movie; however we have an understanding from the previous films (and countless video games, comics, and books) how Space battles work, and how the force works. This movie does not seem to care. It's almost as if Rian Johnson did not bother watching any of the films. After all this is a direct sequel to Star Wars episodes IV, V, and VI - it should not contradict how things work.I left the cinema very disappointed, and did not return. This is the only Star Wars movie I did not see multiple times in the cinema, the only one I did not buy on Blu Ray. After seeing this I could bring myself to watch Solo; I just did not want to be let down again.I give it 3 stars due to how the film looks, and the acting performances of some.

For all we know, Anakin and her could have hooked up, had kids, and she\\'s Reys grandmother, making Rey and Kylo cousins!That\\'s how much this film kept my attention; that I came up with that!Yes, the cinematography is amazing. Plenty of wide open shots of beautiful countryside, vibrant coloured landscapes and natural shots used to evoke the spiritual side of the Force. Add to that the sets used to show the splendour of Canto Bight versus the stark nature of Snokes throne room. And the opening space battle that might evoke memories of old World War 2 plane movies, just set in space. It looked good.The music was pretty under played; the main Star Wars theme was liberally splashed around, but there was no building to crescendos, or much sense of any attempt to build tension.Too be honest, they could have an entire cast of Oscar winners and they\\'d have been hard to get much out of the script! Most of this film might as well have been in 2D; a slow moving car chase that should have been over in minutes if it wasn\\'t for the massive plot holes. When fans are used to epic space battles and dramatic life and death Jedi/Sith encounters that leave you wondering how it will end, everything felt very clunky and thrown together. Even having Frank Oz in the cast doesn\\'t really add anywhere near as much wonderment as it did for Return Of The Sith.I mean, I know Disney is like a Sith Lord strangling someone when it comes to squeezing every dime out of the franchise, but it is annoying that when you should be trying to figure out the standard question of how the Rebel Alliance is going to escape the massive armada - think Return of the Jedi - that\\'s constantly chasing it, but you end up contemplating what toys they\\'re going to make out of those Vulptex or BB-9E!We want Padmé Amidala, not Sabé pretending to be her.',\n",

Meanwhile, the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is scolded for his failure to kill Rey and banished from active duty. Despite his apparent death at the end of the last film, Finn (John Boyega) has survived his encounter with Ren and becomes involved in a mission to sneak aboard a First Order ship and disable a vital component to bring it down.As well as being one of the most enduring franchises, Star Wars is also the one with the most distinctive fan base, the die hards who fill out the sci-fi conventions, and know every character, group and all the general titbits about it. Unless you are one of these dedicated, obsessive fans, which I cannot say I am, then it's just been overkill these last two years, with The Last Jedi marking the third SW related film in that space of time. In the end, I only went to see this one simply because there was nothing else on...and, this time round, I really did think that my time had been wasted.Knowing the loyalty of the fan base, the writers seem glumly aware that the characters (including Princess Leia, marking her final appearance after Carrie Fisher's death last year!) will sell the film more than any compelling story or well written script, and so we have all the main players from the last film in a continuation of events that serves no purpose in expanding the story in any meaningful way. But what's really shocking here is that even the special effects and battle sequences fail to produce any sense of genuine wonderment or spectacle, and leave you as cold and unimpressed as the writing. The majestic wonder of the first three, epic films, which is what flickered whatever faint interest I had in the series in the first place, feels sadly squandered and abused now.

From the unfortunate perspective of a viewer of \"The Last Jedi\", I feel obliged to reconsider my previous opinion. The first movie of this unnecessary postmodern Star Wars trilogy seems like a masterpiece if compared to the absolute tragedy of the last chapter.Cheap humor? Incoherent dialogs? Clichés? What happened to Star Wars, the innovative, mindblowing, legendary franchise that made poeple dream, shiver and sigh?Nothing more than the mere name survives.The authentic vibe of the old trilogies is now so irremediably lost under a pile of easily sellable garbage, that not even a miraculous change in the next chapter could bring it back to life. Which is bitterly ironic, considering that the only purpose \"The Last Jedi\" seems to be aiming to is to live shamefully in the light of the six glorious prequels (yes, even \"The Phantom Menace\").On a less sentimental ground, I must add that, incredibly, the plot of this new movie does not add anything new or meaningful to Chapter VII. The only substantially unexpected events (Snoke\\'s death and Luke\\'s poetic dissolution into the Force) are, but I am not even surprised anymore, treated without the necessary emphasis or the dramatic touch that these moments need. On the other hand, useless characters (I am referring to those played by Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro) and CGI monstrosities (crystal foxes, screaming penguin/hamsters or whatever they are) spend way too much time on the screen.And then one last, unforgivable error : Yoda.Why did they have to use the grotesque, puppet-like figure of the Jedi master which appeared in the first trilogy, while the little green hero as portrayed in the second one was a renowned success worthy of imitation? There are too many questions to be answered regarding this movie, while in the past the only one was : \"when will I watch the next chapter of Star Wars?\".Today, I don\\'t even want to know if and when Chapter IX will be out.

In fact, if you go on to YouTube and type \"everything wrong with the last jedi\" you\\'ll see a video almost as long as the movie itself, that\\'s pretty bad right?From the 40 minutes of senseless cantobite scene, to Carrie Poppins flying through space, to Luke milking a giant space cow, it felt like Rian Johnson set out to purposely embarrass and disenfranchise the most loved characters in cinematic history, then had the audacity to insult anyone who dare say they don\\'t like the movie and as a result they reward him with his own star wars trilogy.After the Force Awakens I was psyched, JJ had set up a new trilogy and left us with a lot of questions, the movie wasn\\'t perfect, but it was a good addition and laid a strong foundation, I wanted to know more. The last jedi, has destroyed the interest I had and I no longer care what happens in this trilogy, I hope they fix it',\n",

Nothing made sense. The Star Wars cartoons and animated series had a better story line than this movie. Disney only cares about selling plushed animals of chicken birds and crystal foxes. If you, like me, thought The Force Awakens was too corny and giddy, this one beats that right out of the park.

It feels like they had many writers not communicating well with each other go off and create their own separate set pieces designed to launch new toys, these sections are clumsily strung together into a showcase of FX. The effects were impressive for the most part, only what I expected though and it isn't enough to hold attention when the story is so bad and badly told, I didn't care about much of the action because I didn't care about the reasons for the action. One new creature was particularly bad FX too.The characters are dull and forgettable, most seem to be there more to make a statement of 'diversity' etc than anything else. There's a couple of older women in it who really smashed any small sense of immersion I might of had, just bad acting and weren't convincingly competent. The general rule is: the white men are evil or weak, females or 'POC' are inherently good, for the most part anyway - it's just patronising, juvenile and very tiresome.I think this film has been poisoned with current political trends and virtue-signalling. Making a film to please modern Feminists, Leftists and SJWs has taken priority over making a good Star Wars film and it really shows, they've gone heavy on The Force being a metaphor for millennial 'feels' too, very cringey. Look out for next Star Wars film making a big statement in support of 'Trans rights' (a 'Trans' Wookie maybe?), and Rey blaming everything on Kylo's 'toxic masculinity'.I've wasted enough time on this film already so I'll end my review here, just be aware if you plan to see it that there is none of the familiar Star Wars magic, no feel good factor, no reason to care and certainly no reason to pay good money to see this.

Hear the sound of spaceships in space from the planet...4. Survives a few minutes in space... And that is just the few very first scenes.This is also one of the rare movie in which I remarked technical problem between scenes. People not being at the same place 1/3rd of a second after, etc.. I generally never detect this kind of issue in a movie. So that must be really huge coordination problem here.In some scene, I was more in a disney movie for children than in a Star Wars.I couldn\\'t relate to any character. Lot of detail didn\\'t make any sense to me as well as many character decisions.Not everything is to be thrown away though. There are very good scenes and ideas too.For example, Laura Dern was just great, and its last scene in the movie is quite beautiful and creative. I also enjoyed some actions and special effects which are generally quite pleasing. But there were very good occasions to make a great movie, and all of them were lost, so in the end, that is not a movie I think I\\'ll remember.

Force powers are distributed as though anyone can pick their powers put of a hat and use them, all lore established in previous Star Wars movies is contradicted, and beloved characters just die for no reason and are barely even mentioned after their deaths.

The entire movie felt rushed, you don\\'t really get to empathize with any of these characters, always running from here to there with another plan/mission. To be honest if felt like I was watching the cinematic cut scenes from a video game.No one seems to keep true to their character, this is most glaring when it comes to Luke. Luke acts in no way like you\\'d expect the character from the original trilogy to act. It\\'s like they said what do we know about Luke, listed all his characteristics, and then said lets do the polar opposite of each one of these things. No one will expect it! Actually that seems to be the entire theme of this movie. Building towards a plan of action, then doing a total 180 just for the sake of surprising the audience with the unexpected. If that happened once I would say \"huh, I didn\\'t see that coming\", and I\\'d applaud them for it.

Plot constituents are snatched away one by one and replaced with ... cheap humor, lame dialogues or stupid loopholes (how Rose &amp; Finn on the ship conveniently survive the blast and kill Phasma is just one of the worst WTF moment). The Last Jedi falls short of epicness (ridiculously small scale battles), consistency and most of all pace. The new protagonists are just ... dull. I couldn\\'t care less if they were to die before the credits or in the next episode. This mediocre sci-fi flick gets even boring at times, far from the thrilling Rogue One.

       " 'With this movie I say farewell to my beloved franchise. I have followed the saga and its Universe since I was born. Like many of you, blood runs deep through me when it comes to Star Wars; but Disney has gone to far with Episode 8 (I wanted to leave at times or vomit). TFA was a crappy reboot movie of a somewhat questioned franchise (all thanks to old fanboys of the originals hating the prequels just because they had to see new stuff&amp;CGI; which I prefer if they enhance my experience). Yet Rogue One brought some great intense depth to very important events around the time the original trilogy takes place. Lets start by saying my biggest concern with TFA was its lack of originality, which TLJ has a bit too much of, hence needless to say I had some expectations with the latest installment. Some where met, like: 1)amazing space battles, 2)ground battles, 3)Luke &amp; Rey and 4)Surprisingly Snoke. The rest is a completely unintelligible mix of scenes and absurd comedic script. Just to name a few: 1)Stupid jokes with Poe&amp;Hux at the beginning, 2)Leia surviving in space &amp; reaching to the ship, 3)Phasma, 4)Yoda\\'s return is disgusting and insulting, 5)Killing of the Jedi with no explanations, 6)Killing Snoke, 7)Killing Ackbar just so we can have another female lead with Holdo, 8)Mutiny, 9)Luke\\'s weird death, 10)Rey\\'s parents, 11)Cruiser chase 12) Lame Kids with rebellion rings, 13) No R-2 (all in favor of BB-8 rise) and (biggest BS) 14)Stupid Canto-Bait subplot with Finn (Imo he had to die in TFA), Rose (which I actually liked her character) and an awkward looking hobo (The plan fails btw) in some futuristic Vegas Casino.Lightsaber battles where fun to watch, but wouldn\\'t watch them again. AND OF COURSE the biggest concern with the movie: PORGS!!! They are AWESOME (Im not being sarcastic). I had fun with these little bird creatures and I approve of them (as with crystal foxes). Still no explanation about the state of the galaxy and its turmoil. I bet we will get a comic or a new TV series about it just so they can make a quick buck. Score: Not memorable and nothing new (stick to original or prequel music)People praise Mark\\'s acting, I found it just ok. Daisy is better than in TFA but still \"meh\" and Adam is probably the best actor of all the cast&amp;crew (and it shows). The rest are \"ok\". No one is getting an Oscar for their performance.  I\\'m no director or screenwriter, but there has to be some sort of control over these new directors and writers taking over (Where is Pablo Hidalgo when we need him?). Who seriously thought Rian Johnson has the ability to carry on this monumental task?! His movies suck!!! They are horrible to say the least and now we have to expect a new trilogy from this guy? I will not be watching that for sure. Other concern is the critics: did they watch the same movie I just saw? How is it that great? Attack of the Clones was better structured than this. And sadly, Star Wars is just an ATM now working exclusively for Disney. I would expect from such a respected and famous company to treat their property with love&amp;care and not burn it to the ground as they have done with 7&amp;8. But in the end CASH is all that matters.3/10. 1pt for the few things I liked, 1pt because of Porgs and 1pt due that BF2 odd looking compass appears. Verdict: Go Watch under your own Risk.

What makes Star Wars so special is the characters, their emotion, family connections, and the main characters connection to the force, and their part in its balance.

       " 'The character of Luke Skywalker is so clearly developed in the original trilogy. He shows up to help his friends and family when in need, no matter what and at any cost. He repeatedly makes selfless, morally sound decisions. He sees goodness in people when nobody else does, even in Darth Vader. To now portray him as a cynical, sarcastic, grumpy old hermit who had it cross his mind to murder his nephew in his sleep (he sensed darkness!) and then isolate himself on an island \"to die\" and avoid cleaning up the mess he made of his nephew makes no sense, even with the flashback explanation given. The same goes for Jedi. Their awesome power lies in cool force abilities and light sabers - ONLY on a SUPERFICIAL level. What really distinguishes a Jedi and makes those characters magical and awesome is their certain noble way of being - that is calm, courageous, and clear-minded in any situation. Despite the movie\\'s title, there is no Jedi to be seen in this film.As for the \"baddies,\" we have two incompetent, bickering rage-a-holics left in Hux and Ren. They are sure good at screaming. Despite Adam Driver\\'s jaw-dropping talent, the Kylo Ren character\\'s primary traits remain confusion and rage. He has no clear direction and thus no real power, no intimidating presence. He\\'s an unsympathetic crybaby and he\\'s going to lose every time, as he has until now.There is so much confusion in the characters overall - and just as much at the end of this second movie as in the beginning. It\\'s likely a reflection of the way the trilogy is being pieced together with multiple writers and no real collaboration between them in creating the characters and story arcs. Rey, Luke, Ren, Poe, Finn... great characters who have no idea what they want in this mess. Snoke, Holdo, and Leia were the most powerful, driven characters in the movie and the only ones who weren\\'t confused at all... alas, those ships have sailed.There were some other aspects to the film that were less than ideal storytelling, or didn\\'t feel right in a Star Wars film, but honestly, I can let everything else slide. The nonsensical discarding of Luke, the Jedi, and the Force had me walking out of the theater feeling tired, hollow and sad, even though I enjoyed and was entertained by many parts of the movie. This movie truly \"lets the past die, kills it if it must.\" It takes us down a glittery new beautiful CGI path with awesome twists, effects, and the sights and sounds of Star Wars but missing the heart and soul of it.

Such a shame because it had all the ingredients (great cast, legendary original characters and what-could-have-been-great new characters, it's freaking Star Wars!) to do something amazing.

       " 'I was incredibly disappointed with Stars Wars: The Last Jedi (TLJ). I cannot believe some people are saying this is the best one since Empire, bcoz it\\'s not even close. There are so many problems with the movie; the writing, the poor structure, the lack of innovation and focus.But first, I\\'ll start with the positives. I think Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill gave a wonderful and committed performance to their roles, despite qualms I have about the material they\\'ve been given. Daisy in particular really shines throughout; she has great screen-presence and is very enigmatic. Secondly, I was surprised by the abundance of humor in the movie. I really enjoyed the comedy and found all the jokes really funny and organic to the story in a way that never feels out of place. Also, the Porgs were kinda cute. Lastly, I thought there were two great action set pieces that really elevated the film above TFA &amp; RO. The opening space battle was quite amazing and well-done. The dogfights and ship battles were very thrilling and suspenseful. Then there\\'s a lightsaber fight towards the end that was just spectacular and could rank as one of the best set pieces in a Star Wars movie. It was also one of the most beautifully shot scenes in the movie, with really impressive lighting, wide angles and long takes to really highlight the complex but excellent choreography.Now the negatives. Overall, I found the movie to be incredibly messy and badly paced. The story is incredibly boring and feel like they\\'re threading the same ground as the original. There were many plot lines that felt lifted whole cloth from Empire and Return of the Jedi, and when they happened I was like \"Are we really doing this again?\" It quickly becomes evident that these movies feel like The Hobbit to the Star Wars franchise - in that, there\\'s not enough material to warrant a new trilogy. TLJ never feels like the 2nd book of a trilogy. It feels more like the 2nd act of an incomplete story. Like TFA, this movie will leave you incredibly dissatisfied. Entire subplots were invented for our main characters, only for the outcome to yield absolutely no results. There were also way too many new characters introduced in the movie, all of whom took significant screen time away from characters that we already know. A character is introduced and is given the kind of epic send-off that should have been given to an established character we know and love, but bcoz we don\\'t know this new character, that send-off lacks any impact. Also, too much time was spent on the island with Rey and Luke and nothing was accomplished. Rey\\'s talents also remains largely unexplained.My biggest issue with the movie however is the depiction of Luke Skywalker. Prior to this, I had read that Mark Hamill was really unhappy with Rian Johnson\\'s direction for his character, and it\\'s true. The Luke Skywalker in this movie IS NOT THE LUKE SKYWALKER WE KNOW &amp; LOVE. Many of Luke\\'s actions seem very out-of-character and contradicts everything that George Lucas had established about him in the originals. There is one particularly egregious act that Luke commits that feels like an absolute betrayal to that character. It undermines all the goodwill of Luke\\'s arc in the originals that Lucas worked so hard to build-up and complete. Also, they seemingly established Luke as the main character and give him the same hero\\'s journey as ROTJ again, only for him to be missing for 45 mins in the movie. And boy, do they really abused the classic John Williams Luke theme in this. You won\\'t go for 5 mins without hearing his theme over and over again.So overall, I did not enjoy watching TLJ. You\\'re probably going to watch it once bcoz it\\'s a Star Wars movie but trust me, there won\\'t be any repeat viewings on this one, bcoz it lacks substance. My theatre audience was silent for the entire movie, saved for a few laughs at jokes that were effective, but there were at least 3 fan service/ shocking moments that should have elicited a response from the crowd, but everyone was dead quiet. You know the movie is incredibly ineffective when even the things fans want to see lands like a thud.So I\\'m giving it a 3 out of 10; two points for that amazing 3rd act lightsaber battle, and 1 point for both Mark and Daisy. For those who are seeking a true sci-fi action adventure experience, I recommend watching Luc Besson\\'s Valerian (2017) instead. That movie is bursting with creativity and feels like it\\'s blazing a new path for the sci-fi genre that these new Star Wars movies should be doing but aren\\'t. Most importantly, that movie feels fresh and innovative, two things that TLJ were seriously lacking.',\n",

       " 'I finally watched this movie last night after months of hearing and reading mixed reviews online and in real life. I watched the entire saga this summer so I could better judge this movie. I am sad to say that this is my least favourite movie in the Star Wars franchise (note: I haven\\'t seen Solo yet). I was bored and found myself looking at the clock throughout the movie. My issues with the movie have already been touched by so many other reviewers here. I think it would have been much more interesting to have the Empir...sorry, I mean \"First Order\" rise to power in Ep 7, take over in Ep 8, and be defeated (or something) by the rebelli...sorry, \"resistance\" in Ep 9. And I\\'m sorry, but to me, Ep 1-9 is about the Skywalkers. If you don\\'t want the movies to be about them, then don\\'t make a movie that takes place when the Skywalkers are alive (yes, I know Ben/Kylo is a Skywalker). The sequel trilogy could easily have taken place 100 years after ANH. If they really, really wanted Hamill and Fischer back, they could have made Luke and Leia appear as force ghosts, leading and instructing the resistance and new force users like Rey though the force. Them being alive in the sequels adds nothing. Luke was my favourite character (along with Obi-Wan) and I am disappointed with how his character was developed. Leia, too (but not as much). There were so much potential in this movie and the sequel trilogy. New characters, new worlds, new conflicts. I feel like much of it was thrown away. So much could have been done better. Some things I found OK: Benicio del Toro\\'s characterIgnoring that they shouldn\\'t suddenly be able to ram ships when they go to light speed: the cinematography of Holdo ramming FO\\'s ships. The silence made it extra powerful. Luke on Crait. I\\'m ambivalent about Luke being a force projection and the brushing of the shoulder was unnecessary. I liked that this scene showed him as powerful and I liked that he was just toying with Kylo.Throne room fight between Kylo and Rey was ok. Overall, I\\'m very disappointed with how this movie, and the sequels as a whole, have turned out. Sadly, I\\'m giving this movie only 1,5/10 (rounding it up to 2/10).This turned out to be a rambling review. I just had to get some things out of me.',\n",
       " \"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a failure as a film and as an episode of a saga. All the plot and the subplots set on the previous films, were built for nothing. In fact, this film destroies all the potential storylines in the name of the Disney's morals that are forced to put into in the Last Jedi. The result is a complete mess like a lot of plot holes, pointless characters, useless storylines, a cringy humour and a lazy characterization.So summing up, now we are certain of one thing: this sequel trilogy is garbage with better visual effects. Disney and Lucasfilm have no idea how to continue the Star Wars saga. So for now, I lose any interests in this ruined franchise...\",\n",

This movie is such an utter mess from the opening scene. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the utter definition of contrived. \"Go on a journey with forced plot point after forced plot point.\"I would not consider myself a Star Wars fan boy, but I do enjoy the Star Wars universe and many of the films. I had mixed feelings for the new trilogy and was adequately surprised by the Force Awakens. There were some aspects I didn\\'t care for, to say the least, but thought of it as enjoyable and that it actually fit well within the Star Wars universe.This movie tries to do the unexplained, but just because something is unpredictable doesn\\'t mean that it is good. Just because something is confusing doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s mysterious. I won\\'t give anything away here but I would say Michael Bay would have done a better job with this film (and I hate myself for even thinking that). Rian Johnson threw out JJ Abrams\\' drafts and anything really related to Star Wars so that he (and the powers that be) could shoe horn in expensive scenes that are purely aesthetic and only skin deep. There is no \"subversive genius\" here and if you think that then, I hate to say it but, you are an incompetent moron and may god have mercy on your soul. I can go on for days about specific scenes and how awful it all is, but there are plenty of other reviews with spoilers.I honestly felt this was a complete waste of my time to watch it-just imagine the time and effort everyone put into making this intergalactic dumpster fire....',\n",
       " 'The Last Jedi, with its motto to \"let the past die\" severs all connections to what made Star Wars special - beloved characters, fans, primordial battles between good and evil, to name a few. Being the middle movie in a trilogy, one would expect this episode to be a conduit that would effortlessly ease us into the finale (even with a few cliffhangers), but its disjoint and jarring narrative has left fans like myself questioning the merit of following the franchise anymore. The Last Jedi makes short work of any fan expectations or build ups over the last few years and destroys legacy characters in its bid to make the new ones shine. It\\'s like Vince McMahon trying to shove Roman Reigns down WWE fans throats by having him beat Undertaker and Wrestlemania. It didn\\'t help there, it doesn\\'t help here. The score and visual effects stand out in an otherwise incoherent story with more plotholes than its predecessor. The movie doesn\\'t even continue plot-points established in the Force Awakens and instead uses the most beloved franchise set in a galaxy far far away, to deliver political messages that are relevant to Earth.Gender and racial equality were never a problem in Star Wars - Leia, Padme, Ahsoka, Ventress are all strong characters who happen to be women, just as Han, Luke, Obi-Wan, Anakin are strong characters who happen to be men. And when we are considering a galaxy far far away, why should equality just be limited to the human species? We haven\\'t seen a single noteworthy alien character in the new series. BB-8 is just a ball, as Han put it with no personality quirks like C3P0 or R2D2. Chewbacca continues to be wasted as a character - Leia hugging Rey instead of Chewie when Solo dies in TFA was a big slap on the face and this movie continues that grand tradition of dissing aliens and droids to establish pseudo-equality. Coming back to the movie, the new characters - Rey, Ren, Poe and Finn all have little or zero character development. 1. Rey still yells and swings her saber like a grotesque neanderthal (Obi-Wan\\'s comment about the lightsaber being an elegant weapon for a more civilized age is lost on her). With little or no training, she bests Luke and a bunch of mook guards with fancy weapons. 2. Ren is still unclear whether he wants to join the dark side or the light side and what was he wishing to complete or finish that his grandfather started? Eradicating sand from the galaxy? 3. Poe is the most wasted character of the new line as he\\'s reduced to an arrogant hot-headed pilot / snob who cannot take orders from a woman4. Finn, the token representative of \"diversity\" is lost in an uninteresting 30 minute sequence that eventually had no effect on the central plot. The worst disservice made by the movie is reserved to the favourite twins of the galaxy - Luke and Leia. Luke\\'s characterization in this movie has been openly opposed by.. well, Luke himself and all the outcry from Mr. Hamill seems justified. We don\\'t see a Jedi or even a monk. We just see a grumpy old man who wants to die alone. Yet conveniently left a map so that people could find him... Luke gets beaten up by Rey (of course, she cannot put a wrong step) and eventually decides to use some form of Force Astral Projection to distract Ren so that the Rebels can escape. He eventually dies alone on the island as he wanted to. Leia on the other hand warps all established norms of the galaxy and travels through space, unprotected and no one even mentions it again in the movie. It is like you see a person\\'s head severed in an road accident, gets up, picks his head and attaches it to his body and walks away while everyone around just say \"ok\" and move on. There is no coherence within the movie, within the trilogy and by extension, within the franchise anymore. Episodes 7, 8 and 9 had a blank canvas to paint on (unlike 1, 2 and 3 which were just vehicles to narrate Anakin\\'s fall) and have failed miserably. The movie is the first in the episodic Star Wars movies to not feature a lightsaber battle and that would probably be the least of the complaints one could have. It is probably the worst Star Wars movie ever made and has potentially killed off the franchise for loyal fans. Sure, it will make money, but no one will care anymore.',\n",
       " 'I have seen many films in my life and only one has made me truly angry. I went in smiling and came out fuming.... Director/writer Rian Johnson didn\\'t understand that he was making a direct sequel to a film as he has now managed to retroactively destroy many plot points from The Force Awakens... It\\'s actually much much worse than Brett Ratner\\'s treatment of X-Men: the Last Stand. A rare feat. Bravo Rian! Where were the signature Star Wars scene transition wipes? Where was the line \"I\\'ve got a bad feeling about this\"? Are you even a Star Wars fan, Rian? In TFA Finn needed a pilot so he could escape the First Order, yet being set literally days after that event he now has the ability to fly anything with ease. Bravo Rian! In TFA there was a map left by Luke Skywalker so that he could be found if the resistance needed him and now he just tosses lightsabers over his goddamn shoulder. He wants nothing to do with the Jedi anymore even though he wears their clothes and lives on their island. Bravo Rian! The Last Jedi features a lot of underdeveloped/pointless new characters while old characters (from pre-Disney) didn\\'t live up to their potential (Luke Skywalker, Leia, Chewie). Costumes (Such as Holdo\\'s dress) didn\\'t fit the scenes - she\\'s an admiral in a battle wearing a ball gown. A lot of hypocritical actions like Leia pushing responsibility for military deaths onto Poe for actions she had the authority and awareness to stop (when Poe led a successful assault to destroy a lethal threat) or when Rose stopped Finn from committing suicide to protect the resistance and then telling him that the only way to win is to protect the people he loves (which is what he was trying to do and almost did, Rose literally almost got the resistance killed). The internal contradictions in this film are laughable. First Order are childish villains and would be lacking punch if it weren\\'t for the resistance being just as incompetent (First Order are supposed to be a military, yet their general is literally toyed with in the opening scene by an idiot, like an idiot). Old characters are humiliated and killed in the most lacklustre ways. Epic Rey training montage missing. Phasma exists, and then doesn\\'t. Snoke exists, kind of reveals his grand plan, stops existing because Deus Ex Machina. To finish, Canto Bite. Even the morons who defend this film agree that Canto Bite was the worst scene.... This movie had large backing, talent, and still ended up in a state which leaves me genuinely stunned at how badly they f*$ked it up. Bravo Rian! \"Your move, chrome dome!\"',\n",

       " \"After seeing The Last Jedi at the cinema last December and being somewhat underwhelmed I was stunned to find out yesterday how little replay value this newest installment in the sprawling space saga holds. I literally couldn't make it through that dragging excuse of a story. Everything the rebellion does is either downright stupid or totally in vain or both. It's a long drawn out exercise in failure peppered with too many bits of comic relief and incessant soulsearching. The prequels were lacking in almost every respect, but at least I enjoyed revisiting them from time to time, they were fun, the storyteller's intentions seemed honest. Not so with the sequels, especially The Last Jedi. It's not only downbeat and endlessly meandering but also mean spirited in its attitude towards the source material. It's willfully disappointing viewer's expectations in the crudest and often least original way possible. You start to choke as if Vadder himself was extending his force grip over the audience. It's all so pointless and half-hearted. The rebellion gets decimated to literally a handful people, but it all seems to be fun and games for the characters, even the bad guys, with a lot of naive pep talk about the spark of the resistance thrown in every ten minutes or so. It's like the director undertook to disappoint viewer's expectations so radically, that we the audience end up with nothing but this choking feeling of disappointment. In fact, the narrative strategy forever flip-flops between those failed expectations and the constant lip service that is paid to the loyal fanbase. It's a schizophrenic experience, one that I'm not too keen to repeat because it leaves the distinct impression that a product is being sold here.\",\n",
       " 'This entry into the Star Wars franchise was an utter dud and will, sorry to say, be ranked as the worst movie in the saga. And rightfully so. After the last movie, this one was set up with so much potential to be great and it failed. Period. It started out showing that potential, however. The initial combat sequence was entertaining, especially the \"I\\'ll wait on hold for Hux\" banter by Dameron. And when Luke takes the Light Sabre, tosses it over his shoulder and tells Rey to get lost was great. Then after that... I don\\'t know what happened. The entire time Rey keeps trying to get Luke to come back reminds me of a kid who keeps asking his mom or dad for something by repeatedly saying \"please\" over and over. It got to the point I was waiting for Rey to pull a Patrick Swayze and repeatedly sing \"I\\'m Henry the Eighth, I am!\" like he did to Whoopi Goldberg in \"Ghost.\" Also, since when does the evil galactic First Order decide to wait out an enemy until their supplies (fuel) run out? This isn\\'t the US Army Civil War siege of Petersburg. All they had to do was just... speed up. Or jump ahead. Or surround them on all sides. Your forces outnumber the rebels by, what? 100-1? And that\\'s the other thing... when Finn and Rose are going to be executed, why all this \"on the count of three!\" melodramatics? Just do it, already. I\\'m getting a little tired of this formulaic approach already. And killing off the supposed ultimate evil leader that is / was Snoke in such an unspectacular fashion just accentuates how underwhelming this movie is.The final scene was akin to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. After Kylo has all weapons fixed on Luke, everyone opens fire. and then Luke walks out of the smoldering rubble and dusts off his shoulder, I was half expecting him to say \"\\'tis but a scratch!\"The only thing that could have saved this movie would have been Rey accepting the offer when Kylo asks her to join him. Now THAT would have been a twist no one saw coming and set up for a fantastic finish. But it didn\\'t happen and this movie leaves you wondering why it was even made because nothing was added or gained by it. If MST3K was still around, they would have a field day with this dreck.',\n",
       " 'The films lack of focus from a narrative perspective is perhaps the most obvious and daunting problem posed by this mess of a film, but it is also aided by Rian Johnson\\'s many failed attempts at humour and fan service that fall well short of the original trilogies energy. Dare I say even Attack of the Clones, possibly the most condemned Star Wars film to date, at least had structure and relevant character development. The Last Jedi however falls flat on its face time and time again throughout its unnecessarily padded runtime, with dozens of \\'shocking\\' and \\'dark\\' moments: quite obviously Johnson\\'s nod toward a darker Star Wars film akin to Empire, which are so overused and rushed in setup that I myself was completely desensitised by any impending twist. From the off, issues with regard to story and editing were prevalent with each scene plagued by over-dramatisation and poor pacing. The very first scene featuring Paige Tico\\'s untimely death is indicative of sequencing throughout the whole movie, with her character kicking that ladder for what felt like a million years before the remote finally fell for an unnecessarily dramatic catch. However Paige\\'s death is just the beginning in terms of exaggerated melodrama, with \\'THAT\\' Leia scene following not long after...With the passing of Carrie Fisher many speculated a heroic final goodbye for her much beloved character. Johnson however, obviously lacking in foresight handles this hurdle poorly, almost taunting fans with Leia\\'s close brush with death on the bridge before she ridiculously flies through space in what could possibly be as cringe-worthy as I\\'m assuming her CGI duplicate will be in the next film. Leia\\'s temporary replacement, Vice Admiral Holdo was also a wasted opportunity, with her character stepping up in Leia\\'s absence as a potential new leader of the Resistance. Not only was her martyrdom another example of a newly introduced character being killed too soon, but it also could have served as a great sacrificial exit point for the late Carrie Fisher if their roles were reversed. Even the manner in which Laura Dern\\'s character was killed off was jarring as her hyperspace insta-kill is honestly a step too far. The destruction level caused by such a manoeuvre will make fans wonder, why don\\'t they just do that all the time? Why didn\\'t they just do that to the Death Star?...Twice?Fans also wondered whether Gwendoline Christie\\'s character, Captain Phasma would finally live up to all the hype as portrayed in advertising and merchandise, however she seems to have been surplus to any real plot movements once more; undoing all added canonical source material that sought to bring her back from the dead after the Force Awakens, and ultimately her characters appearance in the film was as brief as it was pointless... except for all the toys sold in her likeness I suppose. Well-done Disney. Money... Speaking of even more disappointing deaths, we move onto Snoke, a character depicted as the next main antagonist: a character who from early scenes in this film seemed like he might be the most powerful Sith Lord to grace the silver screen yet. His ability to manipulate Kylo and Rey across vast distances was a testament to his unique powers unseen by any other force wielding character in the now pretty average canon that Disney seems to be creating. But it was his signposted death at the hands of Kylo Ren that was most disappointing. A sequence set out to shock the viewer, yet I was not at all surprised at Kylo\\'s betrayal; in fact I\\'ll be more shocked if Snoke doesn\\'t eventually put himself back together when Disney realises that they\\'ve just killed the most interesting character in the film. And of course it wouldn\\'t be the first time a Star Wars villains death was later retconned as Darth Maul once survived being cut in half after Lucas Arts realised they could sell more toys if he was alive again, so all bets are off I guess.And finally I must mention Luke Skywalker\\'s sudden departure. Putting aside the fact that many, including Mark Hamill himself fundamentally disagreed with creative choices surrounding his character... Luke\\'s death was just really silly. A scene that totally lacked any emotion or resonance toward the story, he just simply died and that\\'s that: kind of a spit in the face to kill off such a beloved character in such ambiguous fashion. All these deaths and subsequent lack of empathy from audiences are the result of Johnson\\'s flailing story. The plot can be summarised as succinctly as \"Rebels flee from the First Order\" in an almost comically long car chase, whilst simultaneously the plot with all its throwaway tangents and expendable characters seems almost impossible to discern an overarching story. Moments like Maz Kanata\\'s holo call, Yoda\\'s return (apparently force ghosts can now summon lightning and whack people on the head with sticks), or Rey\\'s infinity mirror scene didn\\'t work to expand the Star Wars world as we know it; alluding to an expanded universe that stretches beyond the main plot as other Star Wars films have done so in the past, rather these moments added unnecessary clutter to an already misdirected catastrophe of a film that\\'s nothing like the Star Wars mythology of old. Much like J.J Abrams, Rian Johnson has looked to both copy and rebuke the classic Lucas mould by adding in uncharacteristic narrative elements that blur the lines between good and evil. And by effectively removing both the Jedi and Sith order by killing Luke and Snoke respectively, the series has set itself up to be more grey and ambiguous in intention. I feel this is what Mark Hamill was referring to when he spoke of doubts... Star wars should be formulaic. It\\'s the classic battle between good and evil, but now Rian Johnson and J.J Abrams in kind, seem to want to leave their mark by reinterpreting and effectively butchering the series oeuvre.',\n",

Man, I felt pretty duped, and I bet you did, too.Well, I thought, they wouldn\\'t do that again...would they? Then I watched the Last Jedi. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Yes, I have seen this film before: parts of it are from a 1980 film called the Empire Strikes Back, and parts are from a 1983 film called Return of the Jedi. Consider:The film opens with the Rebellion, er, sorry, Resistance, having to escape their base by going through an Imperial, er, sorry, First Order fleet. You know, exactly how Empire opened.Later in the film, the rebels are pinned on a white icy-looking planet in a cliffside base that is being attacked by AT-ATs, complete with trenches and towers. It looks exactly like Empire\\'s Hoth scene. Oh but wait, it\\'s not ice, it\\'s...red salt? Oh ok, that makes it not a ripoff then (wink wink).Rey goes to train on an isolated planet with a grumpy but wise Jedi master. Exactly like Luke and Yoda. She even has a dark side temptation hole in the ground that she goes into, where she ends up seeing...her own face! (Ring a bell?)There\\'s the whole throne room scene, where the Emperor is now Snoke, Vader is Ren, and Luke is Rey. Ren, like Vader, kills Snoke.

(Oh wow, my bad, they actually ripped off all three films of the original trilogy).Well, let\\'s not belabor the ripoffs, because there are *other* bad aspects to this movie. Snoke, for one, is unbelievably powerful, but we are never told one scintilla about him. Who is he? Where did he come from? Is he one of the much balleyhooed Sith Lords??? Opportunity wasted. Same for the First Order - zero light is shed, and no one really cares, because we all know it\\'s just the old Empire rudely dragged out of its grave to try and make some money.The characters...who cares. Actually, the lady who plays Rey isn\\'t bad, but she can\\'t save this horribly written mess. Kylo Ren is still all over the map and totally unconvincing as a new archvillain (so much for completing his training). Rose, who appears to be the new Jar Jar Binks annoyance factor, suicidally stops Finn from sacrificing himself to save his fellow resistance fighters, all so that she can kiss him. That\\'s not selfish, right? Then there\\'s the purple dress blondie general who looks like she\\'s more prepped for the runway than the bridge (seriously, is that how military officers dress in far, far away galaxies?). Benicio del Toro acceptably does his squinty loungy thing, but ludicriously convinces Finn and Rose that he can break the First Order flagship\\'s security system when he unlocks some jail cell doors (I\\'m pretty sure they\\'re of the same difficulty level, right?) C3PO has like three lines, none of them remotely funny or original.And on and on. Honestly, there\\'s so much wrong with this film that one review cannot capture it all (read the other user reviews to see what I mean).

Perhaps to best sum it up, just remember that Luke Skywalker\\'s last living lines will now forever be: \"Seeya \\'round, kid\".',\n",

       " \"Star Wars the Last Jedi.It was supposed to build on The Force Awakens, it had the pottential to be a great movie, with more of what Star Wars fans love.Sadly Rian Johnson, had a very different vision.Where TFA setup characters like Rey, to have interresting background story, so we would learn why she was connected to the force, and all that. Ryan took at all, threw it out the window, and decided, let's ignore the vision scene from TFA, make it pointless, and never answer any question about her, but let's make her go down a whole in the ground, do nothing, learn nothing, only waste minutes of screen time.TFA setup Snoke, a powerful villain, we wanted to understand, and learn more about, but nahh, Ryan thought, hmm let's just concentrate on force vision between Rey and Kylo, only to kill of the Mastermind behind them.Kylo was supposed to become this great evil villain, after killing our beloved Han Solo. But Ryan again had a different vision. Let's slowly try and work in a connection between Rey and Kylo, so fans will start to like him again (what the hell?)Ohh and Luke, what could Luke do in a sequal to TFA? Hmm could he be the hope the rebels where searching for, for so long?Nahh Ryan thought, let's only make him walk around an island, being sad, not wanting to help Rey, not wanting to comfort his sister, after she lost Han, not make him do anything remotely meaningful. Only thing he was doing was, a short destraction, which could have been an awesome fight between Luke and Kylo, but instead was turned into the greatest let down, we didn't get to see Luke use his lightsaber, but instead just made him fade away.So in conclusion, TLJ could have build on TFA and shown fans more of what was about to begind, but instead TLJ made Rey's mystery disapear. Kylo into a mess of a chraracter, like Ryan didn't know what to do with him.Leah (Carry Fischer) should have got her heroic end, the scene at the end, where one ship sacrifices itself, could have been an easy way to honor her. But once again Ryan decided let's get a random new character to do that, and let's not use Leah for anything.I wanted this movie to be awesome, but was mostly disapointed all through the movie.3 stars is all I think it deserves, This is the First Star Wars movie, where I don't look forward to seing it again.Hopefully J.J. can turn Episode VIIII, back on track, only time will tell.\",\n",

Yes I was disappointed, and I could feel the hype ebb out, and I could feel the disappointment. And because of TFA my expectations for this one were really low, so it\\'s amazing how it could still cut even lower, and disappoint me yet again. A whole new low.Say what you will about TFA, most of the issues with lore can at least be explained away, or you can pretend there will be a good explanation down the road. But not this time.

Turned him into a cowardly hobo, fighting the main baddie as stupid hologram and then dying of exhaustion, pathetic. General Leia , they blew her off into space , would have been ok if not sad that she would have gone out that way , only to start using the force and flying , yes flying like a cross between Superman &amp; Mary Poppins , then goes into a coma wakes again and limps on through the rest of the movie. With all the original cast members gone now in the stupidest disrespectful ways , it would have been better not to have them back at all , leaving their characters untarnished but well done Disney for messing this up. The director can't have watched any star wars films otherwise he wouldn't have created this load of rubbish . The 1 rating goes for the actors who I thought did well with what they had to work with , just a shame they were let down with poor story and script . Kylo Ren could have been a badass baddie, if they just kept his face covered . Adam Driver has the voice to give you the fear he's a bad guy a quality actor when used right , but let down in my opinion . Rey turns out to be a nobody , next. Snoke turns out to be a nobody , next . Fin and Rose , waste of time , next . They killed Admiral Ackber like he was a nobody . Why is there stupid comedy in this . The originals had comedy but genuine character comedy , it suited the film . This film is cringe worthy cheesey rubbish . Overall this is the worst star wars movie .

       " \"This is what you get when you are so determined to surprise everyone that you want to do against both the fan theory and its opposite. Rian Johnson, the mind behind the awesome Looper, went desperate and stabbed his movie in the balls with a lightsaber.Starting immediately after the ending scene of the previous film, for one joke (not even a good joke for that matter), resulted in tons of retrospective problems.-Finn's injury from the previous movie (remember, his spine got sliced in half) is totally forgotten less than 40 minutes later-The Dreadnought can wipe the Resistance base out in two shots, but where was it during the fuzz with the death planet?-The most meaningless opening text in Star Wars historyGranted, the movie has a few merits. The hyperspace crash is the most epic scene in the franchise ever. Muting it added even more. Johnson, however terrible as a writer, uses the silence very well to increase the drama in scenes that needed it. Another great point was the battle of Kylo Ren and Rey against the Praetorian guards. Though the Force was quite underused, it still had an excellent choreography and an incredible amount of energy. For all three minutes. Out of 150.The real issue comes from the script. It's hard to believe that this is the creation of the man who gave us Looper five years earlier. Any screenwriting class should start with burning the script of The Last Jedi ritually. Where to start?As I said earlier, the number one problem is the fact that it tries to surprise us too hard. 'I am your father' was a twist that cannot be repeated. Even in Star Wars, the first KOTOR game was the only story that could detonate such a mental bomb, and there is a reason for that. The surprises of this film are like the 'I am your father' line told to Luke by Jabba or Chewie. It had too much intention in it, with all fan theories read and trying to make the opposite of everything.How will Luke train Rey? Will he go full Yoda, or take a different direction?He will not train her at all. Let's throw the path of the hero for Rey out the window. She can have the skills of the hero without earning them. Who needs the path of a hero anyway?How gloriously will Luke return?He won't. He'll betray his former self who risked a war to redeem his mass-murderer of a father. This Luke will be revealed as a teacher who tried to kill his nephew instead of guiding him, and will refuse to fix this error by training Rey, he will leave the galaxy to burn. Also, he will go Fahrenheit 451 on ancient Jedi textsWho is Snoke?Nobody cares. At least we, the makers, don't. Let's cut his character arc short (literally). Also, let's write him so terribly that once he's taken out, the viewer will say THANK YOU instead of WHAT. Honestly, he narrates the conflict of Kylo Ren? Writing a Discount Emperor Palpatine is one thing, but this is a new level of horrible.Who is Rey?Nobody. She was sold by her parents for drinking cash. Okay, I'll be fair, this one works, even if there is no reason why nobody told her this on Jakku, and it's hard to believe a 9 year old girl would have forgotten this. Still, it's one of the better twists, as Star Wars already had too much birthright-based protagonists.How will Leia die? Because she must, now that Carrie Fisher is gone, right? RIGHT?Wrong. You all expected her to die, so she won't. She will go full Mary Poppins just so that you'll get surprised. Because you already forgotten her relation to the Force, as it wasn't even mentioned for thirty years, but it was mentioned once in RotJ, so it's a thing now. And she will NEVER kick the bucket in the movie. She is badass, of course, but as Disney promised she won't be digitally recreated for the sequel, EP9 will most likely start with Leia Organa being dead. Talk about disgraceful death for a legendary character.What will happen now?Nothing. We'll just slow down the Falcon storyline of The Empire Strikes Back, and drag it for the entire movie, also remove the soul from it. Who needs a story when we have the best setting in the world? Yes, it's as though the story of Lord of the Rings was 'three goblins sit in a cave and roast meat'. You could have still screwed Tolkien's world if that was the case. The setting is lesser than the story, and even the setting is too minimalist for EP8. A war for the control of a galaxy is fought by approx. 3000 people, both sides summed up. Too small even for any war that happened here on Earth. And it's just one planet. How would a winner of this conflict keep their reign with ten ships? What is this, compared to the fleets that each trilogy's final chapters had? Yes, ROTS had greater battles, it appeared like it really a war on the level of a galaxy. EP7 also had this issue, but it's worse here, as here we are supposed to see the entire armies. It's also overly centered around humans. We need more alien races. Diversity doesn't mean the same on Earth as in Star Wars, and this is another grave mistake.The tone of the movie is another painful mistake. It was marketed as the new trilogy's turn to the dark side. It had an awesome trailer, red letters and all. And what did we get? A parody. Poe Dameron starts the movie by trolling his way through a TIE fighter squadron and humiliating the military commander of the First Order. How am I supposed to take the antagonists seriously, if not even the hero does? He makes a disastrous strategic decision, sends half of the Resistance fleet to die, and it's directly followed by the slapstick scene of Finn waking up. Way to emphasize the tragedy that just happened. This movie is way too humorous. It tries to tell a war story, from the pen of people who don't seem to ever have seen a war. Let's face it: war comedy is not a movie genre with too many example, and there is a reason for that. Especially BB-8 is a total overkill, but everyone is trying to be too funny. The tension is lost, because it's impossible to get invested in a war if every soldier is a comedian.The characters are also total idiots. Admiral Gender has zero leadership skills. This is what we get after the death of Ackbar, the number one meme character of the franchise? Rose speaks about winning a war by saving the ones she loves, a minute after she potentially sentenced the entire Resistance to die for one man, which would have been facepalm material even if they showed a better chemistry than zero. Rey as a character ends up less and less interesting as she turns more and more into a MaRey Sue, who could come from any Discount Hunger Games story, or even a fairytale.The only decently written characters in this movie are Captain Canady, for the five minutes he is on screen, and Kylo Ren. Kylo is still an interesting person, but the insane surprise flow lands him in the role of the mightiest villain. It dosn't work. Not only because he is tricked by a projection that wields a lightsaber Kylo actually ripped apart three scenes prior, but mostly because he works only as a villain apprentice. His character arc needs a superior. A conflicted Emperor is not a source of tension, and this is what we got by the end.Through Kylo Ren, the movie keeps slapping you with the renewal of the franchise. Don't grasp on the classic rules, all are cancelled. Indeed, it expands the limits of the Force for the first time since the Force Lightning was introdiced in the end of RoTJ, and out of three additions only one is a bad choice (Carrie Poppins), the Force projection and the communication trick are genuinely cool. The movie however can't do the renewal well. It ripped apart the Skywalker-lightsaber, because 'symbolism', but the most iconic ships are still the Falcon, the X-Wing and the TIE-Fighter. That's quite far from renewal.Since Rian Johnson got a new trilogy to make, here are a few advices for him1) Go see an actual war, because it seems you need to2) A surprising story is not automatically a GOOD story3) Ignoring the prequels is not a wise choice. Don't take the dialogues from them of course, but take the SCALEAnd finally 4) Send your money on a script doctor, not to censorship of reviews. This is a very important lesson, learn it well. We want our Star Wars back, because this is not it.\",\n",
       " 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the most disappointing thing since George Lucas sold the rights to Disney. A hyped-up sequel to the \"A New Hope\" rip off, this movie is filled with cringe-worthy dialogue, an embarrassing story, terrible editing, massive plot holes, and a surprisingly awful film score. There are some good things about the film however, which confuses me because it\\'s almost like watching two separate movies being smashed together.1) Apparently people can live in outer space now. In the opening fight sequence, the girl on the bomber lays on a beam that is open to outer space and suffers no consequences. Even though she later dies by explosion.2) The bridge of the ship that Leia is in gets hit by a shot and violently explodes and rips everyone into space. The next scene Leia is floating out and about and just wakes up and flies back to the ship. The doors open, and again everyone is exposed to space and nothing happens. Leia dies a very violent death and then just wakes up and goes back to the ship and takes a nap. 3) As the movie continues you realize that all the buildup of Mark Hamill reprising his role as Luke Skywalker is actually a negative thing. When the anticipated moment has finally been reached and Luke is handed his old light saber, he immediately tosses it over his shoulder. This light saber was created and used by his father. His father fought with this weapon in the Clone Wars. It was given to Luke by Obi-Wan. Luke was trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda. He used this light saber to fight his father and save his friends. He turned his father back to the light side and defeated the Emperor once and for all. And in this moment in TLJ all of this history was thrown in the trash. I guess disregard everything that took place from 1977-2005. None of that matters. Luke is absolutely pathetic and behaves completely out of character. He hates the Jedi? He hates the Force? That\\'s a great idea if I\\'ve ever heard one. After a quick visit from Yoda he is changed back to normal, but half the movie has passed by this point. 4) If Luke hates the Jedi and the Force so much and goes as far as to say that it should all end together, AND exiles himself onto an island to die with no intention of ever coming back, then why does he continue to dress exactly like a Jedi every moment of his life? Why doesn\\'t he go back to wearing the attire he wore for the first 19 years of his life? 5) Luke eventually states that he went into hiding because he failed his nephew, Ben Solo, and that Ben has a power that he has never seen before. However, Luke knew Darth Sidious, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and himself. And so far in the past 2 movies in the story line there has been no demonstration that Kylo Ren has any skills at all. Rey defeats him easily in TFA and she has never even held a light saber. In fact, Snoke even makes this point in the movie. You also see Kylo fighting later in the film against Snoke\\'s guards and he is getting slapped around again. Isn\\'t he supposed to be strong in the force? Yet some nobody puts him in a choke hold and almost stabs him. 6) Another huge problem is the distractingly terrible CGI. Snoke is just obnoxious but it only gets worse. The annoying \\'porg\\' penguins and later the giant llamas must have been created by an eager 7-year-old. And how many computer animated explosions can we see in this movie? 7) So Finn and newly added Rose set off on a quest that takes most of the movie to accomplish. Sounds like a big deal but it is simply to find some nobody decoder to stop the \\'First Order\\' from following them. Very nice ideas going on here. Along the way they spend a big chunk of time watching NASCAR pod racing and freeing CGI llamas. Rose tries to explain why this is a big deal but no one cares about this forced subplot. They then get captured and sent to a jail cell where another decoder happens to be there and has been laying around in his cell with a key this entire time. What was he waiting for? Nothing. Actually, he was just waiting for the writers to tell him what to do next. Nice. 8) Later, Poe holds a mutiny against the acting commander and hates her, yet when he is stunned the commander and Leia both comment on how much they like him. I don\\'t think so. 9) After they leave and arrive at the bad guys\\' ship Finn and Rose get captured. The villain, Captain Phasma, does the typical stalling when it comes to execution and has to find a better way to kill them. In the meantime, a lady from Jurassic Park smashes into the ship and kills everyone in this room EXCEPT Finn and Rose. How convenient. Then Phasma and some troopers come walking up in a formation even though they were all just standing right next to each other. Phasma gets shot but her armor deflects the laser bullet. I think the \\'First Order\\' has the resources to make all their soldiers have this armor so why don\\'t they? They have multiple giant space weapons that can destroy planets but armor that works is a little too much to ask? So Finn gets up and has a very anticlimactic fight with Phasma. Why would they have done it any different? 10) The movie goes between Kylo, Rey/Luke, Leia, and Finn scenes. Is Chewbacca just an extra in this film? Because he gets as much screen time as those frog costumed creatures on Luke\\'s island. Kylo\\'s scenes were all very entertaining and Adam Driver was very likable. Rey\\'s scenes were also interesting and I was waiting to hear what\\'s been happening to Luke, but everything else in the movie could not have been less interesting. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been more bored while watching a movie. This is why it felt like two separate movies edited together. 11) After the Snoke battle, Kylo Ren appears to have also killed Hux, but shortly after you see them both standing together. You also see a similar deal when Finn is about to sacrifice himself for the \\'Resistance\\', yet Rose smashed into him to save his life, meanwhile jeopardizing her own. But no worries because everyone is invincible in this film. Except for Luke apparently. I guess using the force one more time was just a little too much for him these days. It was a very uneventful and unheroic death for the star of the original trilogy. 12) All this buildup of finding Luke and he does next to nothing. He aides in the plot which is helping the \\'Resistance\\' keep running but other than that he does nothing. Except for complain and die. He doesn\\'t even have a light saber duel. He uses the force to trick Kylo Ren and pulls out his blue light saber, except Kylo had just recently destroyed that one so why did he think Luke had it??? 13) Before transparent Luke shows up, all the rebel fighters were standing in a hanger with the blast door open watching the \\'First Order\\' stroll in and fire at them. Death and destruction could have easily been prevented and we\\'re supposed to believe these are the people who have been fighting the bad guys this whole time? Are they as stupid as the writers? Oh. 14) Even a lot of dialogue from this movie was very childish and made me feel like I was watching a show created for little kids. Finn is sacrificing himself to save the \\'Resistance\\' and Rose stops him. \"We\\'re not going to win by killing the things we hate, but by saving what we love.\" Well Finn was about to save everyone he loved by killing the \\'First Order\\' but you just stopped him for no reason. And then she gives him an extremely awkward kiss and proceeds to pass out just like Leia did earlier in the film. How creative. Another childish addition is when they\\'re looking for an exit in the cave and a CGI ice fox is conveniently standing in a doorway waiting to lead the people to safety. I\\'m not 9 so this doesn\\'t amuse me. There\\'s a lot of trying to lead you to believe someone is about to die, just to have a cheaply executed save. Boring. 15) The plot of the movie is that the \"Resistance\" is trying to run away from the \"First Order\". The presented problem is that once the \"Resistance\" runs out of gas, the \"First Order\\' will be in range to fire on their ships. Is the \"First Order\" running out of gas too? Is there a reason that the all resourceful \"First Order\" can\\'t cut them off? Or by summoning any ship in their possession? What are all the other \"First Order\" ships doing at this moment? It\\'s supposed to be pretty important that they have the last of the \"Resistance\" on the run right in front of them but all they are doing is following them? 16) Rose was unconscious at the end near the heavily guarded \"First Order\" battering ram. How did Finn drag her all the way back without dying? 17) They even couldn\\'t resist having the droid BB-8 driving an AT-ST walker. I guess the children under the age of 5 need some entertainment too. 18) Disney is in dire need of a thesaurus. Can we get a word count on the word \"hope\" please?! Also, stop with the \"never tell me the odds\" joke. That ended in 1980. Why did C3PO have a red arm in TFA and not in this film? Why is the mystery of Rey\\'s parents never laid to rest? \"Oh they were nobody.\" K thanks for the movie bye. Who is Snoke? Why did he show up, supposedly being the most powerful being, and then die with no known motivation/plans? George Lucas\\' Star Wars movies were told in a unique way that could easily have been told apart from any other writer. It was almost an art of its own. There\\'s a style to making Star Wars and I could tell this movie came out in 2017. There used to be a purpose behind the dialogue, and now it\\'s just schlock. It was like the way Obi-Wan described the light saber; \"an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.\" Now writers are clumsy and random, and people laugh at CGI penguins on the screen. TFA and TLJ both focus on what happened between Episode 6 and TFA, but the whole idea of training Jedi and Luke\\'s interaction with Ben Solo sounds more interesting than the current movie\\'s plots. Or lack thereof. At least Leia wasn\\'t killed off in this movie so I\\'m really excited to see her return in full CGI....',\n",

Between the hatchet job on Luke\\'s character and his arc in the OT, the forced comedy and tonal issues, Rey\\'s force abilities being completely unexplained (I think they are changing the force into a superpower that requires literally no training now based on the scene with the kid at the end), the heavy handed shoehorning-in of the \"next generation\" characters who I find to be completely underdeveloped, unlikable, and annoying, offing Snoke without any backstory or answers. And the biggest WTF moment which was Leia flying through space and turning what at first I thought would have been an acceptable sendoff for Carrie into one of the most weirdest and distracting scenes in the entire franchise. Even Laura Dern was disappointing, there was something about the way she acted her character that was off-putting and didn\\'t really work for me. This movie was an absolute trainwreck. It felt like TFA and TLJ had completely different tones to the point that it was distracting. The way TLJ handled force powers and Rey\\'s unbelievably fast transition into force-god makes me feel like this universe is cannibalizing its own rules and the dissonance between the 3 trilogies is reaching ridiculous levels.My issues with Luke\\'s character in TLJ is that he faced down Palpatine and Vader in the OT, always believing there was good in Vader and successfully redeeming his father. Seeing the good in others is central to Luke\\'s character. Kylo Ren has done absolutely nothing to earn the same level of respect story-wise and from the audience as Palpatine and Vader. He\\'s a nothing, a poser. That has been established by TFA. So Luke\\'s conflict with Ren feels so...wrong. It doesn\\'t make sense. He was being manipulated as a teen by Snoke, and Jedi Master Luke couldn\\'t do anything about it and actually considered murdering him in his sleep before Ben even attempted anything? After everything he accomplished in the OT? Are you kidding me? TLJ not only retroactively makes TFA worse, but also makes the character journeys of both Luke and Anakin less meaningful.I can\\'t be the only one extremely annoyed that they never bothered to flesh out the New Republic AT ALL? Or at least explain how Snoke was able to create such a strong military in the shadows to be able to overthrow the government? Now that the writers established that Snoke was a joke deserving no background or context in lore with his anticlimactic death, we\\'re supposed to believe that the New Republic was just that weak and incompetent?Positives: Benecio Del Toro, the creatures, seeing Mark Hamill again even if his character was butchered. I\\'m glad Rey\\'s parents ended up being a nonfactor, I was holding my breath thinking the movie was going to disappoint me further with an awful reveal.I miss George. The Sequel Trilogy is severely lacking in the coherent vision and themes present in both the Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy.',\n",

       " 'I love the Star Wars franchise. I was so anxious to watch The Last Jedi especially how The Force Awakens ended and how good The Force Awakens was. I bought my tickets a month and a half in advance in anticipation of episode eight. As the movie started I was dialed in for the first 15 minutes then I noticed this subtle uneasiness in me like a disturbance in the force. It began with the interaction between Poe and Princess Leia. She made a comment and made a decision regarding Poe that I found a little unsettling. \"OK.\" I thought. I didn\\'t like that exchange but it\\'s not a show stopper. The subtlety was that Leia was making it seem like the Rebels were in no need of heroes. They didn\\'t need fighters anymore, they needed thinkers (or something akin to that). I took that little shift in philosophy in stride and kept eagerly watching. A couple of other small iniquities occurred but I soldiered forth watching with an open mind because it\\'s \"Star Wars\".Then, there came the interaction between Rey and Luke Skywalker.Luke is part of movie folklore to me. Like many people have the one celebrity they\\'d like to meet: the one fictional character for me has always been Luke Skywalker. Luke was the first hero I\\'d seen wear black. He had piloting skills, light saber skills and could do Jedi mind tricks. He was the coolest.Fast forward nearly 40 years and now Luke is an old man. So what I\\'m expecting is an older, WISER Luke. If Luke is on a deserted planet then it must be for a very good reason. And if Rey found him, much like Luke found Yoda, then Luke will have so much to impart upon Rey. That\\'s not quite what went down. They made Luke a sullen pessimistic old man that was ignorant of simple truths. He offered so little; to the movie and to Rey. He was a shell of his former self, he was only good at being the ex machina. The Luke Skywalker in this movie was NOT the Luke Skywalker I knew. The Luke Skywalker I know was killed in this movie.After seeing my fictional hero relegated to something unrecognizable I actually became bitter while watching the movie. There was almost nothing they could do to save the movie. And they didn\\'t . In fact, it got worse. By the end the movie was more of what I should have saw coming: rebels running from the Republic and figuring out some remote yet heroic way to ward them off. And what added to the annoyingness of this movie is that they didn\\'t know when or how to end it. What should have been the end was followed up by another half an hour mini movie with its own beginning, middle and end.But unlike The Last Jedi I know how to end this post. Don\\'t waste your time.',\n",

It does not deserve the title of Star wars. The plot comes off as horrible fan fiction; my 6 year old self could\\'ve written a better script. This film didn\\'t do any fan service at all or answer all the nagging questions we\\'ve had since the force awakens, which I feel was a good movie. I left TFA feeling energized with a plethora of questions and mysteries to solve. I left the last Jedi feeling depressed like I just found out I\\'ve been cheated on in a long term relationship. My heart is broken, I\\'m sad. I wish we could go back and pretend like this movie never happened.

       " 'I\\'ve never been so dissapointed by a movie in my life...Let me start of by saying the acting, cinematography, sound and so forth was decent. However what destroys this movie is the worst plot/writing/script in history. It doesn\\'t even deserve to be considered canon of the Star Wars universe. Rey\\'s parents who they obviously has teased a lot is apparently some random unknown people... Honestly that\\'s the best they could come up with? Why not make her Palpatine\\'s granddaugther and her parents left her because the \"Resistance\" was after them. That would make a much more interesting story since the people she\\'s now helping are the ones that killed her family! Also it would atleast make it somewhat plausible why she\\'s so powerful. Which now just makes no sense at all, and honestly it\\'s a disgrace to the lore of Star Wars. Okay so another point that\\'s teribble the \"World building\". We get absolutely nothing explained, how did the First order come to be? Who is Snoke? Why are they even called the \"resistance\" when they\\'re fighting for the new \"senate\". And what actually happened to the new republic? Yes some planets got destroyed but surely the galactic republic was more than 5 planets? Well apparently not. Then again why do the resistance use old rebellion equipment, ships etc. Obviously the empire would have left tons of ships, equipment and so forth when it dismantled. And if you thought that wasn\\'t enough they also decided to mess up Luke Skywalker, why not actually let us see him use his powers for real? I read fake leaked scripts where Kylo and the knights of ren went to the Island and while Kylo fought Rey Luke would completely destroy the knights of Ren. That sounds a whole lot more epic than the real script! Now the Casino plot, I didn\\'t actually hate this part, but first of all \"ONLY\" arms dealers are apparently rich in this world.... First of all didn\\'t the \"Resistance\" use old rebellion ships, equipment ? Why would they have to pay for that when Leia always was in charge of this? And again what about all the stuff the Empire left back? Again this is problem with the world building because how the movie presents the First Order they control maybe 1-5% of the galaxy, atleast that\\'s the impression I personally got.. And also we\\'ve never seemed anyone in the SW universe wear a \"Tux\" but suddenly everyone on this casino planet does it... And the overall plot which is \"Escape from the First Order fleet\". That\\'s the best they could come up with apparently... A whole 2½ movie is about one single escape... One would think the people writing this had a bit better imagination but it seems not. And the last point which is more directed towards the series as a whole and not only this movie. Give us something new! The whole \"Rebels vs Empire\" is done so many times now... TFA, Rogue one, Last Jedi and Star Wars Rebels if you count the series. It\\'s just so completely overdone and it\\'s the same stuff every freaking time...',\n",

It is evident that whoever wrote the script to The Last Jedi had no idea what Star Wars was really about and was only focused on money and their own egotistical nonsense. This short-sighted plan to destroy their golden goose just alienated every real Star Wars fan except for possibly new casual fans who don't really care either way. In general, real Star Wars fans have a history of usually going to the theatre for repeat viewings, and you're lucky to get a casual to go see it maybe once. They just destroyed everything good about Star Wars in one film. The Last Jedi is unbelievably bad, I can't emphasize this enough.

The original characters even lacked the charm they had in the original trilogy.1. The romantic plots? Really? It's just awkward. 2. Kylo trying to pursuade Rey to join him?

       " 'I created an account just to review this movie; yes, it\\'s that bad. If I could give this movie zero stars, I would. Alas, I\\'ll let the title of my review do the talking.Initially, before the Force Awakens, I was thrilled to hear about Disney taking over the Star Wars franchise. Lucas had clearly been off of his meds the whole time that he wrote and directed the prequels, so it was promising news. The Force Awakens proved, in my opinion, to be a great start to the next chapter in the Star Wars saga. Nobody could have prepared me for what was about to come next.If Rian Johnson\\'s goal was to make a hollow film that lacked memorable characters or a decent plotline, then I\\'d say mission accomplished. This film ignores many of the facts or storylines laid out in past films, including the Force Awakens itself! Luke\\'s map was a glaring example of this. In The Force Awakens, Luke leaves a map of where to be found if he is ever needed. In the Last Jedi, Luke asks \"How did you find me?\" Ummmmmmmmmm... From that moment on, I knew that this movie was going to be a rough ride.When we last seen Luke on the farthest moon from Endor, he was beginning to make peace with his place in the galaxy far, far away. Fast forward to the Last Jedi and we are led to believe that Luke has become a grouchy and frankly cowardly hermit. Quite the change - I wonder what happened? As the story unfolds, we learn that Luke trained and failed Ren, who ultimately turns to the dark side. We also learn that Luke was going to murder him in his sleep over a vision that he had... So Jedi-like, isn\\'t It??? For his final sendoff, Luke casts himself as a force projection to face off against Ren and Hux. Surely, with Ren being so powerful with the forcehe would know that he was firing at a force projection... Nope, guess again lol.In another gaping movielong plothole, Vice Admiral Holdo and many of the rebels are stuck on a slow moving vessel being followed by First Order warships. Instead of racing in front of it using their hyperdrives, the First Order just slowly follow it through space. How did anyone think that this was a decent way to eat up time in the movie??? Lazy scriptwriters at their finest!One of the least talked about things in this film is Kylo Ren\\'s mask (or lack thereof). This iconic mask was possibly the best part of the new Star Wars films and Johnson decided it needed to go. Can you imagine Darth Vader just being all \"This thing is too hot. Screw It,\" and deciding to do away with the helmet in The Empire Strikes Back? Disney doesn\\'t realize it yet but that move possibly cost them millions, since it was a hot selling item and has now been cast out. Stupid move, both film and marketing wise.Snoke and his origins are never discussed. I try to justify this by thinking \"Well, Jabba wasn\\'t really discussed in great detail.\" While the latter is true, Jabba also wasn\\'t an emperor or master of the force. Snoke\\'s presence in the films is made all the more pointless when Ren kills him easily with a lightsabre in a move that should have been somewhat foreseen, if we are to believe he was powerful to begin with. Speaking of the force, Leia has never shown any physical abilities related to this but apparently, if you toss her into the freezing vacuum of space, she suddenly turns into a Jedi... -yawn-As you can see, my biggest gripe with this film is all of the hollow supporting characters - and main ones too! Aside from not being able to name even half of them after sitting through this monstrosity twice, I really don\\'t see what value they add to this film. I\\'m all for movies casting both men and women equally but at least add substance to their characters. In trying to make this a more gender, diverse-friendly film, Disney ended up playing themselves. For example, the stereotype of Asians not being able to drive is highlighted when Rose crashes into Finn\\'s fighter. Did nobody see the irony there??Rey\\'s storyline is just as hollow and lacking depth as the rest of the film. After the buildup in The Force Awakens, we are told that her parents are nobodies. If this means that anyone can use the force now and be a Jedi with zero training or devotion, then the Skywalker legacy has lost all purpose in these movies.I can safely say after seeing this that I won\\'t be wasting my money in the theatre on the next one. My love of Star Wars is reserved for the rest of the films, excluding Phantom Menace of course because I\\'m a fan of Star Wars and good movies lol',\n",

       " 'In terms of visuals, The Last Jedi is the best looking Star Wars film, shiny bright, wonderful use of monochrome and then adding splashes of red in the climactic battle.It is also overlong, flabby, takes an age to get going and at times feels dull. Just as The Force Awakens made you feel that it was a loose remake of Star Wars: A New Hope. At times you feel an air of The Empire Strikes Back here especially when you see the Imperial Walkers in the desert and the rebels being on the run.The Last Jedi has three subplots. Rey (Daisy Ridley) who has the element of the Force about her meeting Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who has become embittered and reluctant to help the rebels or Rey although he senses the Force is strong in her. Rey of course wants to find out more about her parents but she is also psychically linked to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who himself struggling with his own identity on the dark side. Then there are the resistance ships being hunted by the First Order. With General Leia (Carrie Fisher) sidelined, there is tension between impetus hot shot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) as to how to evade the First Order firepower when you are running on fumes.Finn (John Boyega) the ex-stormtrooper teams up with a clever mechanic Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to go aboard the enemy ship after first finding a master code breaker to disable their tracking system. Finn might be impressed by the high class casino full of wealthy arms dealers when searching for the master code breaker but Rose schools him on the inequalities of life.The film needed to be sharper, it needed a story that was zippy. What we got is a film that tried to be thoughtful but instead became portentous.',\n",

       " 'Star Wars - the Last Jedi is one of the worst big budget movies in recent memory. It is truly terrible. The acting, the directing, and of course the insipid screenplay, all sink to rock bottom, even for a bloated Hollywood blockbuster. As a published film critic with many years\\' experience, I have seldom been angrier at a Hollywood studio for producing such a visually tiresome and narratively muddled mess. Let\\'s be straightforward: I squirmed through the entire two and a half hours of this artistically criminal waste of time and money, from the grammatically-challenged opening crawl to the ridiculous (and mindlessly telegraphed) anti-climax. Watching this movie was worse than having teeth pulled; it was the long, gut-wrenching and bloody agony of recovery afterwards. Above all, this Disney-produced disaster was a cinematic embarrassment. At least with the absurd Marvel movies we have costumed heroes to root for, and our own world to fret about. Who could care less about the anonymous locations and bland characters of this latest assembly-line installment of the redoubtable Lucasfilm franchise? George Lucas once stated the Star Wars movies were made for kids. Watching The Last Jedi as an adult is a stupefying experience, leaving one wondering if any adult had anything to do with its writing or direction. Indeed, the movie feels as if a sugar-hyped horde of grade schoolers mismanaged the entire enterprise. A film criticism usually begins with generalities of story and character and then moves on to critique specific aspects of the production, picking out special moments and positive components while throwing in a few negative zingers to entertain the reader. The Last Jedi is so completely bad I cannot comment on a single good scene. I cannot think of one. What else can I say? I suppose the visual effects were relatively benign, with John Williams contributing yet another journeyman score, but in a cinematic fantasy universe filled with black holes of plot, character and storytelling there can be no purchase. I was adrift watching this disaster - as any mature adult should be - so perhaps the only compliment I can pay to the production is \"better luck next time.\" The problem with that is Jedi follows on the heels of the clichéd A New Hope remake The Force Awakens, which at least introduced new characters (even if they turned out to be the same old cardboard). The Last Jedi is so bereft of original thought and design, it makes The Force Awakens look like a brilliant new concept by comparison.Still, as critic, I have a job to do -Star Wars - The Last JediTEN WORST CINEMATIC MOMENTS10) The Korean space plumber kisses Finn. WTF? (as today\\'s gadget-obsessed teens might say).9) Vice-Admiral Dern suddenly becomes a hero. Wasn\\'t she supposed to be a villain? Or at least a traitor?8) The strange little bartender from TFA makes a sad, confused, animated cameo. Again, WTF?7) The opening crawl. I mean, really, how much did they spend on this disaster, a quarter of a billion dollars, and they couldn\\'t hire a high school English teacher to check the language and punctuation? A prelude to the horror to come.6) The telegraphed meaning of the \"bloody\" footwork on the red salt planet. So we can figure out Luke is not really there. Though it\\'s not made obvious enough to be obvious, or interesting. A perfect example of the movie\\'s messy confusion.5) All those amazing dialogue rip offs from other Star Wars flicks. Kylo/Ben: \"Join me and we\\'ll bring order to the universe.\" Seriously? Bring order to your haircut, Driver.4) Speaking of Ben/Kylo - Adam Driver is astonishingly bad in this movie. As if Francis Coppolla directed him from a trailer next door. Cinema fans know this reference.3) The bad acting overall. At least Daisy gives it her best. Everyone else phones it in (yes, you, Benecio) or seems to have been hired right off of Hollywood Boulevard. Abject evidence of a creatively absentee director. 2) The comic relief moments that were only painful. My favorite is when the Yoda ghost chides Luke for not having perused the Jedi text. A work sacred to acolytes that is actually unreadable? Sounds like Mein Kampf.1) I could put the anti-climactic ending here, the rip off - er, reference to - The Empire Strikes Back, with the rebels in disarray and a black-clad evil avenger on their trail, but why ignore the best of the worst? The whole casino sequence! A hapless, CGI-stuffed \"reference\" to a James Bond movie, with gambling and shooting and car chases and \\'SPLOSIONS - with a few cute alien critters thrown in for measure. So stunningly unnecessary it boggles the mind. All for a Benecio cameo. Yes, you, Benecio. Okay, we had our fun. Now let us put blame where blame is due. The true villains of the piece. And they more than deserve it.Kathleen Kennedy is a corporate suit with decades of producing clichéd rip-offs of better works from the past, who could care less about storytelling and character craft. Her concern is the bottom line. Period. Reducing a beloved film series to an assembly line process, and a greedy accountant\\'s wet dream, seems to be her only goal. Running former series characters and storylines through a crass corporate machine, allowing broken cogs and cracked wheels to work them over, is no problem for such as she. Congratulations, Kathy, you got a Yugo. As for the man credited with \"directing\" this dreadful mess, his name deserves no mention, neither praise or contempt will he receive from me for a complete artistic or even professional absence from this production (and the fact anyone would allow such a talentless hack to \"create\" more series movies only proves Hollywood to be the artistic hell with which most of us are very familiar). Speaking of talentless hacks - Let us focus our blame on J. J. Abrams. Why? He produced the insipid faux SF TV series Lost, where a muddled mess of storyline was legendary. He ruined Star Trek with two blatantly unimaginative TV movie-style con jobs of third tier SF genre junk. His complete lack of originality, good taste or imagination is self-evident in everything he does. The Force Awakens was a blatant remake of A New Hope, and he did not stoop to care. Just have him move on to the Marvel universe and get it over with for goodness sakes. Perhaps Robert Downey Jr. can play Sherlock Holmes as Iron Man, a steampunk kind of thing. I\\'m sure the pork-bellied Comic Con fanboys would eat it up.Lastly, there\\'s Disney. This big business behemoth inches forward through profitability by consuming other companies and better artists\\' ideas. Without Grimm\\'s fairy tales they would have been out of business way back with Steamboat Willie. Instead, they stagger onwards, spending billions acquiring Marvel and Lucasfilm, merging it all into a gargantuan postmodern corporate octopus with its slimy, Lovecraftian tentacles penetrating all of mass media. Their only concern is crass corporate survival, so they can continue to regurgitate (ie remake/reboot) the same stories and movies ad infinitum ad nauseum. Selling tickets is nothing compared to hawking plastic trinkets in warehouse stores. Disney extracts their consumer \"entertainment tax\" and the willing masses have no problem capitulating. Selling McDonald\\'s happy meals is the be-all and end-all of their entire cinematic enterprise. Finally, how about the fans? Many hated this movie and deservedly so, but mostly because of the way the studio suits treated the Luke Skywalker character. His story arc finished long ago, with Return of the Jedi. Personally, I am quite over his character. And the way Mark Hamill capitulated from his initial criticism of the suits having the Jedi Master crumple into fairy dust at the end of this vacuous episode makes my stomach turn. Yet the fans love Mark. He seems to be a nice guy. Too bad he has completely sold out. Folks, you get the movies you deserve. You continue to pay for stinky fish, you keep getting stinky fish. It\\'s that simple. Let\\'s face it, most Star Wars fans don\\'t know (or don\\'t care) that George Lucas ripped off countless other, better fantasy and science fiction for A New Hope. Has any of you fanboys/girls actually seen Kurosawa\\'s The Hidden Fortress? Let us get to the point, because Hollywood junk peddlers like Disney drive it home: cinema is dead. The cinema we grew up with, loved and adored as fans and students of the art. The digital age (among other worse things, like crass mass media corporatism) killed it. As long as studio bosses and their small-minded, slavering minions greenlight assembly-line superhero movies, and the fans pay for it, nothing will change. When a movie as supremely awful as The Last Jedi makes bank, the bankers smile - and cinema never rises from the dead. Long live cinema.',\n",
       " '***Spoilers***In short this movie, albeit directed by Rian Johnson, was another Jar Jar Abrams style unoriginal hack job copy paste from its predecessors; jam packed with special effects, prospective toy animals and story ideas of people who I presume, think that they are clever and/or special, but to their own detriment are not.What Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy &amp; Co. did in the Last Jedi is berserk tabula rasa butchery of not only the original trilogy but their own work TFA as well, in terms of consistency and story. Sure they have to sell new books and create newer cooler characters, and when they can\\'t they just make the old ones uncool to make the new ones look cool, if that makes any sense.Let\\'s go deeper.First of all, as far as Star Wars goes, I like the original trilogy a lot and respect it, I really disliked the Force Awakens because of its mock-Emperor and Darth Vader wanna be villains, its Mary Sue protagonist and the script which was copy pasted from \"A New Hope\". But if I was to develop a sequel to TFA I would have to respect it even if I do not like it and keep it consistent.But this film though, I hate it. Yep very strong words I know but unlike the film my feelings are sincere. I feel like Disney thinks that they can get away with any chance they take with the franchise because fans will flock to the theaters no matter what and throw away their money.I did not like the \"Lost\" style building up of intrigue and mystery Jar Jar tried to pull off regarding Snoke and Rey\\'s origins and reasons for Luke\\'s reclusion in the Force Awakens, and it is evident in this movie that they did not think it through in TFA to have any developed story or ideas about them then. Abrams, Kasdan &amp; Arndt were just winging it. And evidently when Kathleen Kennedy and Co. &amp; Rian Johnson decided they cannot wing it in this movie, heck they just kill the people / ideas off without explanation. For instance:Quickly they make Ren smash his mask. Yay no longer a Vader copy, he\\'s a real boy now.Again quickly, snoke is killed by Whino Ren, while bragging how supreme he is (and we still did not learn who the bleep this guy was in the first place).Lastly and in 10 seconds we learn that Rey\\'s childhood is a byproduct of bad parentage by insignificant no name junk collectors.But the worst for me is the guy we love for being able to overcome the dark side and refused to kill his fallen father which in turn led to the Emperor\\'s undoing, Luke Skywalker, according to this movie freaked out upon sensing the dark side in Ben Solo and tried to kill him in his sleep, just for a moment. The guy who stood for optimism and was literally \"the New Hope\" who redeemed the unredeemable bad guy Vader, reduced to a hermit that turned his back on his loved ones, and killed off Obi Wan style, with the most ridiculous new force power of projecting interstellar holograms. Dude please.Another major issue I have with this movie is that Disney, Rian Johnson or whomever is ridiculously desperate to be perceived as politically correct, diverse and inclusive; but in the end they come out as insincere since they just shove down an unnecessary parallel and nonsensical story arc of Finn and Rose with a little social commentary on capitalism, which is rich coming from Disney. As you know Disney has a rich history of depicting minorities (!).Suffice it to say I will not be paying Disney for anything from now on. I definitely won\\'t watch another Rian Johnson movie either.Anyhow if you\\'re still reading let\\'s make a soft exit by listing minor but nevertheless still very annoying stuff about the film:If you really wanted a Lando type character, here\\'s an idea why didn\\'t you just put Lando in the movie. Mr. Williams is alive and well last I checked.You call that jedi training?Luke milking an alien and drinking it caveman style?I didn\\'t see a point in the character Vice Admiral Holdo.I still don\\'t see the point of the character Maz Kanata.Force skyping of Whino Ren and Rey, I\\'m no millennial nope, not for me.Forced Marvel style humor every 2 minutes, I don\\'t even like it in Marvel movies.1 ewok type cg animal to be sold as toys is unbearable, 3 is just repugnant.Damned Disney killed of Admiral Akbar.And on and on and on... I am having a very hard time how critics can overwhelmingly like this piece of trash, I would still despise it if I was not a fan. Can a company really buy critics off? Not a fan of conspiracy theories but it seems like it. I will not be reading professional critics\\' reviews from now on.',\n",
       " \"Where to start? I've no idea, literally none. When your film is massively inferior to The Phantom Menace you know you have a bad film on your hands. The first thing I'd like to point out is the worst case of man-hating on a film I have ever seen. Literally EVERY single woman in the film is a superhero (Super Leia is the best example) Even the one female baddie is depicted as someone you should pity, but without exception every man is either stupid/cowardly/sinister/insane or pointless - even to the point when a man tries to do one heroic thing he gets stopped from doing by a woman for, reasons. Plot holes galore (How does someone who has no substance in one scene embrace someone in another?) The ripped off new hope in the last one, and this one tries to do a greatest hits of empire and jedi but manages to make it completely uninteresting.

       " 'I just got back after watching the last jedi and i still dont really know if i found this movie good or bad. First the things i liked; The space battles looked amazing.The lightsaber battles were very well doneI liked the character rey much more this time, i hated her in TFA. Still not my favorite char tho.Most of the jokes were funny, i really laughed about chewie with the porgs.most of the acting was well done imo.Things i didnt liked:The chase the cruiser plot that dragged on far 2 long imo. The whole rebellion fits on 1 cruiser? how can they even be a threat to the first order that seems to have a endless supply of star destroyers and even bigger ships. New republic gone, first order rules and this gets just glossed over except for 1 sentence in the title crawl. I would like to see abit more of the political state of the galaxy to explain the rebels/first order further. Snoke dying like a wimp and we still dont know anything about him. Most useless villain ever. General Hugs and kylo almost equally useless. -The Finn/Rose plot without any payoff. This part of the movie felt very forced, just to give finn something to do. Again this movie felt very sjw-ish just like TFA.Overall i just be glad once disney finishes this trilogy and can move on to something completely new. The whole rebel / empire/first order starts to get really boring and without resolution in sight. Same for the jedi / sith story, seems like ive seen it all before.',\n",
       " \"Unlike many people I didn't mind 'The Force Awakens'. Its purpose was to set up a new trilogy and introduce us to new characters, which I think it did very well. Though it took very few risks and was very similar to 'A New Hope', it had reasons for it.Now we move onto 'The Last Jedi'. I was very excited to see this film, especially after the stunning trailer that was released a few months back. There was so much to explore and so many questions to be answered. I wanted to see these characters we were introduced to in the previous film to develop further. I was expecting a story that would thrill me and leave me on the edge of my seat. That unfortunately didn't happen.Though this film is visually stunning and the score is as always incredible, it has one major flaw. The story/writing. I think a big reason for this is that Rian Johnson wanted to create his version of Star War, and although that results in some interesting ideas, it also discards a lot of what was set up in 'The Force Awakens'.The Good -I enjoyed the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren, as well as Luke's conflicting feelings about the use of the force and the way of the Jedi. The clashing of ideologies, and the inner conflicts of these characters made for some very engaging and interesting scenes. I also thought there were some well directed and visually stunning scenes, particularly when either of these 3 characters were present. However, thats where the good ends.The Bad -The film never seems to move forward. Finn and Rose's plot line was very cringe worthy, and impacts the plot in no way whatsoever. The only thing there subplot had going for it was exploring the themes relating to weapons dealing (which was not explored enough to have any impact on the story or characters). Benicio Del Toro's character was interesting, particularly with his ideologies, but was criminally underused. Phasma was also a let down. I thought after the previous film she might go out seeking revenge or at least become somewhat more of a threat to the main characters. Unfortunately not. Also, most of the film involves a rebel ship trying to outrun a large imperial vessel. Poe and Leia were great to watch, but nothing significant really happened. The scene where Leia returns to the ship using the force seemed out of place and didn't really fit with what we've seen in previous films. I also thought had she died it would have been much more impactful. It's also worth noting, the entire subplot with Finn could have been avoided had the Vice Admiral put in charge actually told her plan to the crew. As an audience member, her sacrifice had no emotional weight whatsoever, and her character kinda just appeared and was used up very quickly. Also, how is it there just so happens to be a rebel base right below the rebel fleet. Very fortunate.Then we move on to Snoke. In 'The Force Awakens' we believe him to be a huge threat. A menace whose intentions we are keen to discover. When we see him in this film, he demonstrates his immense power. Then he is killed off as if he was of no importance whatsoever. This results in multiple issues in my opinion. It diminishes the set up that was built in the previous film. It means we are unlikely to discover why he formed the First Order, where he came from or what his intentions with Kylo were. Kylo is an interesting character, and I thought it would have been interesting to build up his inner conflict even further. Instead he becomes the main overruling villain, replacing Snoke. the problem is his character doesn't suit that role in my opinion. He works better as a conflicted character, and now he has become leader of the First Order, he is stuck in the villain role. So, we're right back where we started. The First Order and the Rebellion are on equal playing fields, and nothing significant has really changed or developed. Also, how did Rey learn to use the force so quickly? It belittled her development a somewhat substantial amount.Overall, I'm quite disappointed in this movie. It has some high highs, but at the cost of some very low lows. I would probably watch it again as it was somewhat entertaining and had some interesting scenes, but I consider it to be a bad film and I can't say I have high hopes for the next instalment. I feel very let down by this film, which is a shame because after 'Rogue One' I know Disney can do so much better.\",\n",

There were multiple script plot holes &amp; dead ends, character inconsistencies, and even continuity errors all throughout the movie. Without the story line errors, this movie could have ended within the first 25 minutes. The Last Jedi is the perfect example of franchise over marketing and poor film making. I feel, much like The Room, The Last Jedi will be shown to film classes for years to come of what not to do.\",\n",
       " 'I was keeping a running tally of the number of cringeworthy moments in this film, but I lost count at 12. There was still an hour of film left.I feel completely betrayed as a Star Wars fan. Enough with the forced jokes and cringy one-liners (yes folks, the first scene of this film involves a repackaged \\'yo momma\\' joke and sounds like the beginning of a Verizon commercial). Enough with the re-hashed scenes, useless characters, and \\'twists\\' that are on the verge of lunacy rather than anything founded in the Star Wars universe. \\'The Force\\' is NOT a blank check for you reconcile anything you want! There\\'s something woefully wrong when commanders of the First Order are cracking jokes a few rooms away from Snoke, and members of The Rebellion are having kissy time while the remaining few of their group are on the verge of being wiped clean. There are other much more obvious examples, but I\\'ll save sharing those on the off chance that anyone actually decides to go see this movie.The viewer gets the impression that the new era of actors are high on the line of coke that is the original trilogy, while the actors from the original trilogy are more than content taking the backseat - the ultimate clash of overdone and passive acting of any movie I\\'ve seen, and no, they don\\'t balance each other. (General Leia Organa literally has a line where she states \"Well what are you lookin\\' at me for?\"). Not leadership, apparently. Nonetheless, I\\'m thankful for seeing the movie - if nothing than as a form of non-validation. Its confirmed that the Star Wars universe deserves so much more than Disney or the directors and producers they contract could ever give it. I had so much Hope for the new Star Wars movies.

       " 'I really wanted to like this movie, but it\\'s terrible. I honestly can\\'t think of a single good thing about it other than the music (almost all of which is from earlier Star Wars films) and that it isn\\'t a remake of The Empire Strikers Back. Besides that, there\\'s almost nothing good about it.The pacing is terrible, and it jumps between scenes with completely different emotional tones and, despite being the longest running Star Wars movie ever, seems to constantly be speeding through everything. Extremely important story moments are covered in only a few minutes, while unimportant scenes seem to stretch on as long as possible. Most people I talked to had little idea what the plot even was, aside from the information provided by The Force Awakens.The plot makes no sense either, and would be avoided if the characters weren\\'t complete idiots who make mind-numbly stupid decisions, such as hiring shady criminals in a prison to help them, or wanting to escape on ships that they know don\\'t have weapons. There\\'s also no explanation as to the current political situation, and it\\'s unclear what\\'s even happening in the Galaxy at large. It\\'s not even hinted at as to who\\'s funding the inexplicably recreated Empire, and it\\'s not even clear if the New Republic still exists. Worst of all, everything was reset and everything that ever happened in the original movies means absolutely nothing now. Every victory ever won by the Rebellion, every superweapon destroyed, every system liberated - are all meaningless. Han Solo returned to being a smuggler and divorced Leia and was murdered by his son in the most obvious trap imaginable, Luke Skywalker became a failure and ran away to pout on a deserted island and also ultimately died, and the New Republic the rebels fought and died to create was destroyed in five minutes of screen time by a new Empire which is inexplicably strong enough to build a planet-sized superweapon which is now left to be opposed by a new Rebellion which itself will ultimately be destroyed when they inevitably make another trilogy.The writing is insulting. There\\'s one scene where Leia is sucked into the vacuum of space and somehow survives floating through it for several minutes and pulls herself with the Force to her ship. The dialogue is filled with \"jokes\" which are always as out-of-place as possible. When the entire Resistance is evacuating there\\'s a scene where Leia turns to C-3PO and says to \"wipe that nervous look off your face\", or something to that effect. Rey is still a flawless Mary Sue, while Luke Skywalker\\'s character was completely ruined, and he went from leading the Rebellion to victory against the Empire and being set to recreate the Jedi Order to a failure who attempted murdering one of his own students and burning down the original Jedi Temple. Yoda\\'s ghost shows up to burn down the temple for him through the Force, which begs the question of why force ghosts have never interacted with the physical world in such a way before, and if they can why Yoda doesn\\'t just go stop Snoke and Kylo himself, who wouldn\\'t be able to fight back as Yoda is already a force ghost.The cinematography and directing are also terrible. Even though the sets and environments are beautiful, the camera seems to have no idea what it\\'s supposed to be doing. It will randomly cut away from the characters for two seconds to the top of a mountain or something else nearby and cut immediately back to them as if nothing happened, and other times will cut between different characters, forward in time, or even to dreams or hallucinations without giving any indication that it switched to something else. The film also seems to have an obsession with randomly making things slow motion and silent during action scenes, which feels out of place in a Star Wars movie and also extremely overused given its inclusion in seemingly every action scene.',\n",

So wait!!! Skywalker was able to detect a tiny portion of good in the most feared villain of all time Darth Vador, yet he could not feel the same for his own nephew who was the son of his sister and best friend. We built upon Luke skywalker\\'s problems in the original 3 movies and his the Last Jedi his character is 100% totally different. Someone who was always passionate to save, help, and learn is now broken, miserable character. We also hardly ever see Rey get training, and some how she become instantly more power than Luke Skywalker in a light saber dual. Later the big moment we were all waiting years for \"Who is Rey\". Oh well she is a nobody. Turns out she was just a child dumped on a desert planet by junk/scrap people. Yep! I waited 2 years for what I was expecting a big moment where Rey was related to an older Star Wars character but NO!Then last but not least we have Snoke. We see him for about a total of 20 minutes in the film, and he gets killed halfway through the movie with no background information to who he was or where he came from. He\\'s made to be more powerful than Palpatine yet he gets killed on after an incredible short screen time. If he was so powerful where was he during the time of Palpatine and Darth Vador? How did he become ruler of the First Order? Why did Luke Skywalker not know or challenge him? (Skywalker admits in the film he knew Snoke was trying to trick Kylo Ryn). But no, none of these questions are awnsered. We are just meant to assume he is a new bad guy on the block, with no background, apprears to be more powerful than Palpatine, and he gets killed halfway into the movie.

What\\'s the fun in watching people who always interact the exact same way for a movie that feels so tediously long?The story also slams shut so many doors that the universe contracts like a collapsing star.

Everything\\'s been answered here, and in such a way that it\\'ll never be revisited - after having had no impact.The tone is also a bizarre mishmosh of Marvel snark that makes the tone indistinguishable from any other meta schlock from the past decade. The movie prides itself on \"deconstructing tropes\" but does so just by implementing different tropes, ones of \"oh my tech doesn\\'t work, this is awkward,\" \"I came up looking heroic and have a moneyshot and then immediately fell over,\" \"literally everything you just said is wrong,\" or \" \\'You don\\'t want to hear X.\\' \"Yes I do.\\' \\'X.\\' \\'You\\'re right, I didn\\'t.\\' \" instead of, you know, character development.

       " 'The Force Awakens was a somewhat divisive film, but apart from the common complaint that it was essentially just a remake of The New Hope, most people seemed to have liked it. It did not kill my interest in going forward to see this film; unfortunately, I cannot speak as favourably of The Last Jedi.When I saw this movie in theaters for the first (and only) time, I immediately picked upon a major problem; it is incredibly self-indulgent in it\\'s subversiveness, which is essentially just a nice way of saying it\\'s unpredictable. While that\\'s not a bad thing in itself, but when you do it at the expense of all else, including character development and storytelling, what you get is a series of twists for the sake of having them, regardless of whether they actually make any sense or not, resulting in a good chunk of the entire movie being rendered almost entirely unnecessary in retrospect. The Last Jedi feels like it just repeatedly pulls the rug from under the viewer just so it can say \"gotcha!\", but you know what they say; fool me once...On hindsight, another major issue with the film is it\\'s complete disregard to it\\'s own legacy. I\\'m not even talking it\\'s introduction of some serious issues in the rules of the entire Star Wars universe as a whole, or about turning Luke into an old, decrepit, miserable hermit (and I\\'m not even going to talk about what I see as blatant character assassination), but it fails to even develop the characters introduced in The Force Awakens. In fact, that\\'s something of an understatement; the characters either don\\'t develop at all, or they\\'re essentially reduced to two-dimensional parodies of themselves who plod their way through the film in displays of massive incompetence and/or foolishness. I know making characters act stupid is a common storytelling device to keep the story going forward, but The Last Jedi abuses it to a nauseating degree.Much has been said about the new characters as well, they\\'re really not that much better off. Rose Tico in particular almost feels like a parody of a typical college liberal. Her dialogue reveals her naivety, and her actions reveal her failure to consider possible long-term harmful effects in favour of short-term \"feel-good\" benefits, and in one instance in particular the former kicks in almost immediately on the background after she makes some adage about it, which in any other film would come off as a biting satire - I only say she almost feels like a parody, because I\\'m positive it was not intentional. It merely demonstrates utter cluelessness on the behalf of Rian Johnson.The film may be impressive visually, but the inside rings hollow. With all the characters worth caring about either dead, flat or reduced to stereotypes, there\\'s just nothing left for me to care about in Episode IX. The franchise is clearly in the hands of people who do not care about it. I guess Rian Johnson does get the last laugh with his biggest subversion of all; the expectation that this movie might\\'ve been even remotely decent. Needless to say, I\\'m not going to see it.

They don't always just want a spectacle to distract them and should desire more than that from films they admire. The film lacks in substance and that is what is intuitively being reacted to from those who expected a break away from the same old story that Star Wars has been regurgitating. Here was an opportunity to explore the gray, honor the past while moving forward (which JJ Abrams symbolically had already done and begun in The Force Awakens) and bring Star Wars to the 21st century. We did not want a glossy updated look on Star Wars, we tried that back with the prequels and the rest is history.Will you be entertained? Yes. Will you be shocked by some of the choices? Sure. Will you at the end of the day shrug it off as passable? Si.

But at least those movies helped to establish Star Wars cannon and lore. They added worlds and characters, and helped to expand the universe we love. The Last Jedi, in comparison, is a parasite movie. It rides along on the lore it inherited, contributing nothing while consuming everything, it uses up and destroys lore and characters, but adds nothing. It's bungling director clear had no idea he was meant to take the baton, then pass it on.The Last Jedi ends pretty much exactly where it starts, minus a few characters that were unceremoniously killed off. Luke Skywalker dies for no real reason, Snoke dies for no reason and without ever being explained. Basically, we're supposed to take this as a changing of the guard, except the new generation of Star Wars characters, Rey and Ren, aren't even a shadow of the great heroes and villains of Star Wars of yore. The movie is a long boring sequence of failed attempts to do things, which ultimately fall flat, and eventually leave you wondering what the point was. There's no real character arc or progression for anyone, Rey basically teaches herself The Force because learning from Skywalker would be perpetuating a patriarchal construct. Kylo Ren is utter flaccid as a villain, he mostly yells and strains so hard you're worried he'll burst a blood vessel. Everyone else's performance serves no purpose and could have been edited out without affecting the final result of the movie. The forced humor is cringy, the forced love connection between Rose and Finn is cringy, the casino scene is straight of a cringy Lucas brainstorming session. Worst of all, this movie leaves no reason to want to watch its follow up. The characters and mystique that could have been are dead and gone.

Her parents and their history is simply brushed aside, important questions as to the discovery of Luke's original lightsaber and how it was reacquired are simply brushed aside as unimportant questions in Rian Johnson's mind.Kylo Ren still comes across as a whiny brat and the latest young Anakin wannabe.And worst off all, Luke Skywalker looks completely disinterested in the script simply starting for a big paycheck.When he Skywalker SPOILER dies at the end, (from running out of Force power of all idiotic things) the majority of Star Wars fans were seriously unsatisfied.After all, if Ryan Johnson wanted to kill off yet ANOTHER Star Wars character he should have killed off Princess Leia Organa, after Carrie Fisher's tragic death back in 2016.All in all I thought I would never say this, but very few people I know of are looking forward to the next two Star Wars films, Solo, A Star Wars Story has been plagued by bad press and the firing of it's original directors, and Episode 9 has the difficult task of picking up the messy pieces of Rain Johnson's dysfunctional script.

Alas, behind a great cast and phenomenal special effects, there lies a weak script and underdeveloped storyline. Everything we were introduced to in Episode VII was stripped away. We were given the most linear, non-compelling Star Wars story since the plight of Jar Jar Binks.Instead of describing why I am giving 2 stars for superb special effects and 2 more for originality, I'll describe why it's missing stars. For 2 of these missing stars, it's easy enough to point at the plot that was bashed to death with a rusty blaster pistol. Replaced by a politically correct agenda, a poor miscommunication of story direction; the plot failed to captivate or engage me. Another couple of stars are taken away for having a linear and meaningless story. There are many examples of underdeveloped scenes and dialogue, especially when it comes to Cantobyte. I'll use an age old reference: Pulp Fiction. My favorite scene is when Christopher Walken explains the meaning of Bruce Willis' deceased fathers pocket watch. Instead of meaningless dialogue that did not propel the story further, it instead gave a window in Bruce Willis' characters life.In The Last Jedi, we get to see how Rose was impacted by slavery on Cantobyte, only to have it be irrelevant after they escape. Her actions do not reflect that of someone who has been enslaved and wishes to see it end.The last two stars are taken away for ruining the expectations of the fans. It's alright when new movies are released with no ties to a franchise and underperform, but when a cultural phenom like Star Wars is released, Disney had better put the fan first. That's the best way to captivate an audience and create a timeless masterpiece, that the original trilogy succeeded in doing.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve always considered myself as a Star Wars fan that can keep a long and good talk about the saga.When I went to see The Last Jedi, I had a bad feeling about it, since the trailer wasn\\'t that good.But I had good hopes on the movie to be good enough, as fans could see Luke Skywalker fight like we never experienced before and show us how the best Jedi ever returns to the big screen.But Rian Johnson had different objectives for the character...After the ending of The Force Awakens, I think I talk for everyone here, we were expecting for the best for the next film.Then Johnson happened... An amateur film director that took a story bigger than him, took the responsability of characters he shouldn\\'t have had. He literally destroyed everything Abrams built for what could have been the best freaking Star Wars movie the world could\\'ve seen.He made Luke \"look\" like an old and weak man who is now afraid of even going out of a cave because of a mistake he made with Han Solo\\'s spoiled kid.And that\\'s the smallest problem of his \"creation\"-What happened to Ray?In The Force Awakens, Ray had that charming behavior and innocence that made every man fell in love with that character.In this film, I was sad for what I was watching, but it was gone, and Ray was just a simple character.-Leia...can fly?I\\'m sure I\\'m not the only one who almost walked out of the theaters after that scene with Leia using \"the force\", levitating and returning to the ship. LIKE WHY?-The Porgs...Rian Johnson thought it could be a great idea to introduce Pokemons in his film. So that\\'s why we have those small, not funny birds that make a Jar Jar Binks of the movie.I\\'m not a hater, but I hated those creatures.-The awful comedy.That\\'s the only thing I\\'m gonna say... I did not laugh in this movie, in fact, I wanted to cry.Benicio del Toro?I love del Toro, but his character is just bad, and he is not the only one...Many characters in this story were just a bad idea to introduce.-Luke dies.As a fan, I think the idea of Luke dying and the way he dies is good. But happened TOO SOON!You want to know how to make a perfect Star Wars movie?Just get Luke Skywalker out of that cave, make him remember he is still the best Jedi the world has seen and put him to fight for 40 minutes of the movie with Kylo Ren and the Stormtroopers.You wait and you give him a proper death a few minutes before the ending of the trilogy.Or, leave it like that and make your hero look weak and alcoholic and die while leaving his \"spirit\" to fight for him.(That scene was great, I have to admit it. Luke\\'s spirit vs Kylo. That is the only scene I liked of the movie, that\\'s why I put 2 stars instead of 1)-A New Hope, please.Now, the only thing we can do is to wait for JJ Abrams to return and be our only hope, giving this weak trilogy a proper ending.',\n",

As others have noticed the glowing so-called critic reviews seem highly suspect for such an awful film.I was actually hoping the bad guys would win and eliminate the nauseating scooby do Disney goodies and put an end to this shlock, alas it was not to be they survived.Actually I find it quite fascinating just how abysmal these films can get.

Aside from there being so much moments and scenes that just didn't make sense when it comes to star wars the movie also dosen't focus on the main cast and story enough and as it should've but goes out of its way to make it blatantly obvious how politically correct it is. Now its so much more politically correct then TFA that it's cringeworthy at times and scenes will feel more like watching a commercial then a movie.

Then there was *cough* supreme leader Snoke.Well...he vanished like a fart in a hurricane.After an entire movie building him up to be Emperor Palpatine, he was in fact as expendable as a stormtrooper...what a waste.Now for the point in the movie I hated the most.I believe the place Finn and Rose go is called Canto Bight, it's a planet with a huge casino that the rich frequent. This entire side story massively distracts from the main plot and serves as nothing more than a low brow attempt to point out the greed involved in war and introduce us to some terrible CGI effects.This was the point in the movie I knew it couldn't be saved.On the subject of Finn and Rose, they were involved once again, in not one, but two scenes, that I might have forgiven (maybe) if the movie was better.Firstly both Finn and Rose were in handcuffs, with hundreds of stormtroopers surrounding them, the ship is then hit at light speed and everyone on the deck is killed, apart from Finn and Rose of course...yippeeThen in another scene Finn decides he needs to sacrifice himself to stop the ramming cannon (not sure that's the correct name) by driving into it, Rose on the other hand decides she needs to stop him killing himself by potentially killing the both of them and proceeds to smash into him at 200mph, while 30 feet in the air (too dumb for me to accept) oh and by the way she just met him for the first time a day earlier. Both characters were badly written and their scenes added nothing to the movie.Lets move on to the fact that Rey at no point in either movie has any training, yet is as powerful as Kylo Ren...lazy lazy writing.Laura Dern was pointless, and the movie dragged whenever she was in it.There was a quasi-political feel to this movie emphasised by its casting choices, which I just about forgave in the force awakens but not in this ham fisted mess. NEWS JUST IN...Princess Leia can purposefully move her limbs, and use the force, all while completely unconscious and floating in the vacuum of space. Unfortunately she thought it served the rebellion best to keep this to herself and stand around looking concerned, while telling others to go off to battle... bummer.Now... unfortunately whenever I watch the original trilogy, I know that Luke becomes a hermit, cowering on an island, who hides a piece of a secret map in R2D2 for people to piece together, and then after the loss of many lives in trying to protect these map pieces, he tells them to get lost after they eventually find him... troll much...he also drinks milk straight from the teats of an alien cow/elephant.\",\n",
       " \"Just as episode VII ruined the ending of VI, this film ruins the character of Luke Skywalker, at least if you consider these Disney created films as canon. Many of the core elements which were present throughout Lucas' films are again absent in Disney's third attempt at making a Star Wars film. For example formerly central characters such as C3PO and R2D2 again take a back seat, popping up only occasionally to silence fans who might criticise their absence. Similarly beloved characters Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia are again treated like garbage to make way for new characters who are not even half as interesting. Likewise, lightsaber battles are again almost non-existent despite their universal appeal and a romantic comedy's worth of humour is shoe-horned into the film at the most inappropriate of moments.All of the mysteries which were left after episode VII were answered or brushed aside in the most lazy and uninteresting ways, leaving almost nothing worth watching to occur in the next installment. The film, like the last two, is a simple cash grab by Disney and a group of filmmakers who have no regard for the universe Lucas has created. It almost seems a compliment to call the film fan fiction as I struggle to believe any fan could serve up such rubbish. The highest level of canonical material is that which was created by George Lucas, Disney will tell you that their films are a continuation of his story, but in reality they are nothing but a tool for generating profit.\",\n",

If this movie feels like it captures the soul of Star Wars, then you've slept through most of the original trilogy. I get what Rian Johnson was trying to do here, but not to the expense of previously well known and established characters like Luke and Leia. Underwhelming, disappointing and useless sequel to The Force Awakens. There, a new storyline was built and by the end of this movie we're in the same situation, minus some characters. The plot didn't advance; it's like the director made his solo take in the Star Wars universe in the middle of a trilogy. Daisy Ridley acts better here, compared to TFA, Carrie Fisher gives her second best performance in this universe, after The Empire Strikes Back, and Hamill brings his A game for this one. But in a story that doesn't understand its lore and previously established movies, nothing matters in the end. SW became SJW, with little care to a rich history and apparently only interested to please Di$$-ney and Kathleen's needs for diversity. This is not a Star Wars movie, doesn't have the heart (but it has more forced humor, thanks Disney) and doesn't capture what made this franchise a Force to be reckoned with.

The only good in this movie is the emotional performace from Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher despite how their characters were written, the CGI was gorgeously done and the costume and makeup team also did a stellar job.

The trailers suggest that Rey gets a kick ass hard training by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who is determined to restore the peace in the Galaxy after the will of the Force brought Rey to him just after the First Order blasted so many planets to dust...But no, he is an afraid old man and is whining all movie long that he wont do anything. I thought he would have discovered that being a Grey Jedi, fyi Jedi that find a balance between dark and light, is the right way to bring balance in the Force and that he would learn Rey to do so and eventually get Kylo Ren to understand. But NO. Disney doesn't give a crack. It's all about children watching that want to buy the toys.I hoped there would be some good and plausible reveal about why Rey is so extremely talented in using the Force. Like she was the sole survivor of Kylo destroying the temple, the twin sister of Kylo and that Luke has used the Force to manipulate memories of Han, Leia and Kylo to keep her safe after the turn of Kylo and the rise of the First order. But enough of my broken dreams. Rey was just a skunk daughter, because it's so politically correct and good for children to learn that someone can be an important hero without having a certain background. Thats apparently more important than the Skywalker legacy. FORCE BREAKDOWNMastering using and understanding the Force takes YEARS of training and Luke only got fast on it because he was the son of The Chosen One and therefore extremely Force sensitive. This Rey can do anything just because she is Force sensitive. That's not how the Force works, our dear Han would say. It rejects all of the training Luke needed, the whole Jedi order from the prequels and makes it some sort of randomness WHICH IT ISN'T. It couldn't believe it. I just couldnt. Force Facetime calling between Kylo and Rey. If only my previously mentioned idea that they were twins should be true, BUT NO. This is NOT how the Force works.LUKE SKYWALKER HUMILIATEDHe hasn't learned anything from his isolation on the sacred Jedi Island, he wont help the galaxy that is being destroyed by the Dark Side. He's a grumpy old man that got bested by a little girl called Rey in a stick fight. The final scene was impressive and showed of his developed Force powers as would the son of Anakin Skywalker after 40 years of being a Jedi. AND THEN IT KILLS HIM. Man o man.THEY COULDN'T GIVE PRINCESS LEIA A PROPER GOODBYECarrie Fisher, such a shame she had to pass. They had the chance to bring something up to give her a royal and honorable goodbye, giving her life for the Resistance. But no, she will just get a mention in the next opening crawls. Disney has no respect for any Star Wars aspect.PREQUEL DISRESPECT WITH YODA APPEARINGI don't know what kind of fan you are, but the prequels aren't so bad anymore after SW VII and VIII. They put in the original trilogy Yoda ghost burning down a Jedi tree. Anakin calling to Luke to encourage him to save the galaxy, his nephew and train Rey would be the right thing to do. Emphasizing that Vader died a Jedi. The prequels were only mentioned once telling that the Jedi suck because of letting Darth Sidious take over. Alright, thanks.OTHER CHARACTERSSnoke was a real cool Sith in the beginning, humiliating Kylo for being weak. And now he just died. Kylo killing him was a good move, after all Sith also hate each other, but WHY NOW ALREADY. We needed more background and him training Kylo in the Dark Side, keeping him there. Now Kylo is supreme leader with some weird loser admiral at his side. Finn kissing some random Asian girl while being in love with Rey, him killing Phasma, it's actually not even worth mentioning. Poe is okay but him taking over the Resistance is just making it seem weak.R.I.P. STAR WARS, KILLED BY DISNEYGeorge Lucas is laughing now, for being criticized for the Prequels. You now know what bad Star Wars is, ungrateful fans, he grins. Disney just destroyed Star Wars, the Force, the Skywalkers, everything.

He just invented all these new force powers: Yoda\\'s shade interacting with the physical world by calling down lightning, Luke\\'s projection that could actually be physically felt, Leia surviving the vacuum of space (this was almost laughable). Ugh. Just Ugh.TLJ was hugely anticlimactic on so many fronts: Snoke, Luke, Rey, Phasma and Ackbar. Even TFA opened up new possibilities with Snoke (who is he? How did he meet Kylo?), Rey (what\\'s her lineage?), the mysterious Jedi island (what\\'s in the texts?). Part of the magic of the original trilogy comes from the open-ended potential for backstory given all the possibilities created. Witness Kenobi\\'s oblique reference to the Clone Wars way back in Episode IV. I feel like This director got lazy and just closed all these doors without bothering to explore them. Further, the anticlimactic demise of Phasma reminded me of the anticlimactic demise of Boba Fett in ROTJ - another badass looking character meeting a very weak end! Finally, instead of introducing Laura Dern\\'s character and then having her making the ultimate sacrifice (no one cares about her), why not have Admiral Ackba do it? Hell it would\\'ve been epic if he said \"It\\'s a WRAP!\" as he crashed the cruiser into the destroyer. Certainly would\\'ve been better than having him meeting an unceremonious end just as a mention as a casualty. So many wasted opportunities.

Luke is not Luke like the character said \"This is not going to go the way you think\" That\\'s 100 percent correct. I also agree 100 percent with Mark Hamill\\'stated to Rian Johnson that he Fundamentally disagreed with everything about how Rian wrote about his character.This doesn\\'t even get into the bad acting poor writing boring story. the one thing they were able to do is keep the secrets from the movie from Leaking no one would have every even guessed it its so bad.',\n",
       " 'The movie itself is well created. It´s beautiful visuels great space battles and so on. But thats about it.This \"Star Wars movie\" is so far from what it should be. Too many wasted characters. To much backstory left unclear. Hardly stays true to the star wars we love and know. It just dosent add up. Their is no continuity from the old movies lore and ways, that defines Star Wars.I have no idea how episode 9 is going to recover from this. I sincerly hope that disney scratches episode 7 and 8. Start over and redo everything, for the fans.',\n",
       " 'Plot twists turned to plot anarchy. Ryan Johnson effectively throws out Chekov\\'s gun principle in favor of the much more dictatorial \"all that matters is what the writer thinks matters in this exact instant; it might be forgotten or brushed off 20 minutes from now\".A lot of story logic and story direction was sacrificed to make the heroes as heroic as possible and the message the movie delivered as inspirational as possible. I appreciate the intent but Star Wars is a fantasy with some fable-like moments. Treating this movie (or any movie really) as a sacred text that teaches our kids morality is just presumptuous and unnecessary. There should be a balance here. Mixing two generations of characters proved this trilogy\\'s undoing. Not enough time was devoted to the new cast who got lost in the countless B-plot story lines and need to showcase Han. Luke, and Leia. Love all the new heroes, btw. The SW OT was build on friendship and romance; the PT on family. Even with all the special effects and action, the relationships between the characters is what made these movies shone (some more than others). Our main cast in this movie has never spent any time all interacting with each other. Poe and Rey met in the last five minutes of the movie. The movie as a result is an emotional wasteland. Ditto for not thinking of a way for all the OT cast to get together for a scene in TFA, however short the scene might be. This movie was an emotional wasteland. The New Yorker used the following adjectives to describe this bold new SW world: \"abstemious, de-mentalized, militarized\". I couldn\\'t agree more.I had no issue with how some classic elements from Star Wars were discarded or reinterpreted. However I have to say that putting such emphasis on these same elements (Anakin\\'s lightsaber for example) in TFA and then literally tossing them aside was baffling to watch. I am not one bit surprised by fans angry about that just because of how these elements went from significant to who cares. If you really wanted to be bold, Lucasfilm, perhaps you shouldn\\'t have brought these elements up in the first place. You can\\'t have your cake and eat it too. Sorry!Speaking of bold, there were some interesting ideas in this movie. But somehow we ended up with an evil man in black armor with a red laser sword who is in command of a faceless army bent on subjugating the galaxy, a rag tag team of rebels who resist him and all space tyrants. and a young inexperienced jedi who is helping the rebels. That sounds... familiar? Hopefully, episode 9 does something unexpected with that set up.The movie was profoundly unfunny. The only thing the quippy one liners achieved was to undercut the tension and diminish the story\\'s impact. And the funny parts were not meant to be funny. Leia flying through space is not bad, but the way they portrayed it was. The space chase was just Family Guy Star Wars or Space Balls level of absurdity. By all means show us new ways the force works! But the long-distance yet tangible force hologram was just distracting.Heroes are as good as their villains. The First Order are caricatures. I guess that makes it more palatable for kids when they see the First Order ships carrying thousands of members of the First Order blow up.I had no problem with the death of Han Solo or the fate of Luke Skywalker. But know we know the OT trio led sad, strife-filled lives and never escaped the conflict that formed them as human beings in their youth. It\\'s like their hope and dreams were crushed with age until it was time for them to pass. That\\'s a very nihilistic statement that anyone who is currently under 25 will have the pleasure of discovering as they re-watch the movies in the future.I just can\\'t see how the movie is nuanced. The bad guys are badder than ever. The good guys are more heroic than ever. It\\'s good vs evil; light vs. dark. Nuance never did play a role in this universe. Lets not fool ourselves that it does now.The special effects were very nice, but 99% of all the vehicles and even of many aliens were just tweaked designs we have seen before.Ryan Johnson, I am still a fan :). Maybe both sides on this debate will reassess their position and we will meet half way.That said, the entertainment media\\'s reaction to any negative opinions about the movie has been sad to witness.',\n",

I had the most chills when the man the whole movie is dedicated to find, finally appeared at the end of the movie. I remembered some article mentioned that Steven Spielberg loved it so much, that he watched 4 times.Guessed he's disgusted by the latest installment now. I clapped hands with the other viewers when the majestic theme started playing. But i did not clap when the movie ended.

I am not picky at all, as some users have written, such as Cap. Phasma not given enough depth. But I walked out after the end of the movie with a WTF feeling.Maybe Carrie Fisher wanted no more part in this rubbish, so she decided maybe its her time (God rest her soul) to bid farewell for good. (I will edit and remove this part of the content should any members condemn me for joking about the most-loved CF, no disrespecting intended at all).This is not a review to sway Star War fans or movie-goers away from this ep8.

       " 'Star Wars - the Last Jedi is one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. It is terrible. The acting, the directing, and of course the insipid screenplay, all sink to rock bottom, even for a bloated Hollywood blockbuster. As a published film critic with many years experience, I have seldom been more angry at a Hollywood studio for producing such a tiresome, confusing and indeed boring mess. Let\\'s be straightforward: I squirmed through the entire two and a half hours of anyone\\'s waste of time and money, from the grammatically-challenged opening crawl to the ridiculous (and mindlessly telegraphed) anti-climax. Watching this movie was worse than having teeth pulled, it was the long, gut-wrenching and bloody agony of recovery afterwards. Above all, this Disney-produced mess was a cinematic embarrassment. At least with the absurd Marvel movies we have costumed heroes to root for, and our own world to fret about. Who could care less about the anonymous locations and bland characters of this latest assembly-line installment of the redoubtable Lucasfilm franchise? George Lucas once stated the Star Wars movies were made for kids. Watching The Last Jedi as an adult is a stupefying experience, leaving one wondering if any adult had anything to do with its writing or direction. Indeed, the movie feels as if a sugar-hyped horde of grade schoolers mismanaged the entire enterprise. A film criticism usually begins with generalities of story and character and then moves on to critique specific aspects of the production, picking out special moments and positive components while throwing in a few negative zingers to entertain the reader. The Last Jedi is so completely bad I cannot comment on a single good scene. I cannot think of one. Not one. What else can I say? I suppose the visual effects were effectively \"awesome,\" but in a cinematic universe filled with black holes of plot, character and storytelling there can be no purchase. I was adrift watching this disaster - as any mature adult should be - so perhaps the only compliment I can pay to the production is \"better luck next time.\" The problem with that is Jedi follows on the heels of the clichéd A New Hope remake The Force Awakens, which at least introduced new characters and planetscapes. The Last Jedi is so bereft of original thought and design, it makes The Force Awakens look like a brilliant new concept by comparison.Still, as critic, I have a job to do -Star Wars - The Last JediTEN WORST CINEMATIC MOMENTS10) The Korean space plumber kisses Finn. WTF???9) Vice-Admiral Dern suddenly becomes a hero. Wasn\\'t she supposed to be a villain? Or at least a traitor?8) The strange little bartender from TFA makes a sad, confused, animated cameo. Again, WTF??7) The opening crawl. I mean, really, how much did they spend on this disaster, a quarter of a billion dollars, and they couldn\\'t hire a high school English teacher to check the language and punctuation?6) The telegraphed meaning of the \"bloody\" footwork on the red salt planet. So we can figure out Luke is not really there. A perfect example of the movie\\'s messy confusion.5) All those amazing dialogue rip offs from other Star Wars flicks. Kylo/Ben: \"Join me and we\\'ll bring order to the universe.\" Seriously? Bring order to your haircut, Driver.4) Speaking of Ben/Kylo - Adam Driver is astonishingly bad in this movie. As if Francis Coppolla directed him from a trailer next door. Cinema fans know this reference.3) The bad acting overall. At least Daisy gives it her best. Everyone else phones it in (yes, you, Benecio) or seems to have been hired right off of Hollywood Boulevard. More evidence of an absentee director. 2) The comic relief moments that were only painful. My favorite is when the Yoda ghost chides Luke for not having really read the Jedi text. A work sacred to acolytes that is actually unreadable? Sounds like Mein Kampf.1) I could put the anti-climactic ending here, the rip off - er, reference to - The Empire Strikes Back, with the rebels in disarray and a black-clad evil avenger on their trail, but why ignore the best of the worst? The whole casino sequence! A hapless, CGI-stuffed \"reference\" to a James Bond movie, with gambling and shooting and car chases and \\'SPLOSIONS - with a few alien critters thrown in for (bad) measure. So stunningly unnecessary it boggles the mind. All for a Benecio cameo.Okay, we had our fun. Now let us put blame where blame is due. They all deserve it.Kathleen Kennedy is a corporate suit with decades of producing clichéd rip-offs of better works from the past, who could care less about storytelling and character craft. Her concern is the bottom line. Period. Reducing a beloved film series to an assembly line process, and a greedy accountant\\'s wet dream, seems to be her entire goal. Running former series characters and storylines through a crass corporate machine, allowing broken cogs and cracked wheels to work them over, is no problem for such a suit. Congratulations, Kathy, you got a Yugo. As for the man credited with \"directing\" this dreadful mess, his name deserves no mention, neither praise or contempt will he receive from me for a complete absence from this production (and the fact anyone would allow such an talentless amateur to \"create\" more series movies only proves Hollywood to be the artistic hell with which most of us are very familiar). Let us focus our blame on J. J. Abrams. Why? He produced the insipid faux SF TV series Lost, where a muddled mess of storyline was legendary. He ruined Star Trek with two blatantly unimaginative TV movie-style rip offs of third tier SF genre junk. His complete lack of creativity is self-evident in everything he does. The Force Awakens was a blatant remake of A New Hope, and he did not care. Perhaps he\\'s a devil, ruining franchise after franchise, stacking up piles of shekels as he goes. Just have him move on to the Marvel universe and get it over with for goodness sakes. Perhaps he can have Robert Downey Jr. play Sherlock Holmes as Iron Man, a steampunk kind of thing. I\\'m sure the pork-bellied Comic Con fanboys would eat it up.Lastly, there\\'s Disney. This big business behemoth inches forward through profitability by consuming other companies and better artists ideas. Without Grimm\\'s fairy tales they would have been out of business way back with Steamboat Willie. Instead, they stagger onwards, spending billions acquiring Marvel and Lucasfilm, merging it all into a gargantuan postmodern corporate octopus with its slimy, Lovecraftian tentacles penetrating all of mass media. Their only concern is crass corporate survival, so they can continue to regurgitate (ie remake/reboot/re-\"imagine\") the same stories and movies ad infinitum ad nauseum. Selling tickets is nothing compared to hawking plastic trinkets in warehouse stores. Disney extracts their consumer \"entertainment tax\" and the willing masses have no problem capitulating. Selling McDonald\\'s happy meals is the end all of this entire cinematic enterprise. Finally, how about the fans? Many hated this movie and deservedly so, but mostly because of the way the studio suits treated the Luke Skywalker character. His story arc finished with Jedi. That was thirty-five years ago! I am quite over his character. Folks, you get the movies you deserve. You continue to pay for stinky fish, you keep getting stinky fish. It\\'s that simple. Let\\'s face it, most Star Wars fans don\\'t know (or don\\'t care) that George Lucas ripped off countless other, better fantasy and science fiction for A New Hope (which I will always refer to as Star Wars). Has any of you fanboys/girls actually seen Kurosawa\\'s The Hidden Fortress? Cinema is dead. The digital age (among other worse things, like crass mass media corporatism) killed it. As long as studio bosses and their empty suit minions greenlight assembly-line superhero movies, and the fans pay for it, nothing will change. When a movie as supremely awful as The Last Jedi makes bank, the bankers smile - and cinema never rises from the dead. Long live cinema.',\n",

       " 'When it comes to a Star Wars movie, there are always two aspects to review: how it works as a film, and how it fits into the larger universe. The Star Wars shared universe is truly remarkable in terms of scope and longevity. It is very soft sci-fi, but generally stays true to rules established in the original 1977 Star Wars.Past Star Wars movies have been of varying quality as films from beloved all-time classics like Empire Strikes Back to much more controversial entries such as Attack of the Clones or the Phantom Menace. However, their world building has always been exceptional with the prequels giving us some of the best additions to the universe (Coruscant, the Republic, the Clone Wars) The Last Jedi manages to completely and irrevocably damage the shared laws of this universe. It damages and humiliates all remaining characters from the original trilogy, but also treats the newly established ones from the Force Awakens with contempt. There is no contribution to world-building in this movie. Why is the First Order suddenly so powerful? What is happening to the Republic? Are our heroes fighting for the Republic, the Resistance or the Rebellion? All three terms are used interchangeably and it makes absolutely no sense. I would argue that on the movie side of things, we are given exceptionally good cinematography. This is certainly the best-looking Star Wars movie ever. We are also given very good sound design and a good but not great musical score. Visual effects are very good too. This is where the good stuff ends, sadly. The dialogue is arguably worse than in the prequels (yes, worse than \"I don\\'t like Sand\") with cringe-worthy lines everywhere and misguided humour that only ridicules characters and is totally out of place everywhere. While the editing is done competently, many editing choices are questionable at best, leading to awkward moments and uneven pacing. There is no real climax, nor the build-up to one and the movie is too long by at least half an hour. The plot is incredibly poorly written with more plot holes than any other Star Wars movie I can think of. It is also rather boring with the slowest space chase in cinema and ridiculous amounts of plot armour for some of the protagonists. Plenty has been written about the humiliation of Luke Skywalker. Once a great hero who sacrificed everything to save his friends, who believed in the good in everybody, even Darth Vader. Gone he is, consumed by Rian Johnson. Now we get a grumpy old hermit who doesn\\'t care whether the dark side wins, and who insists the Jedi have to die. This might be appropriate if the last movie before this would have been a disaster for the light side Revenge of the Sith was, but it wasn\\'t. Obi Wan seemed to have no such depression in spite of witnessing far greater calamities. Luke\\'s character in this movie is plain bad writing and inconsistent with the original 6 movies. It also doesn\\'t make a lot of sense in light of the events in Force Awakens.In one of the most unforgivable choices, we are seeing Rose mourn for her sister, we see Chewbacca mourn for Han, but we never get to see Luke mourn for Han Solo. Yes, you read that right: Luke Skywalker doesn\\'t mourn the death of his friend of 35 years who saved him about 20 odd times in the OT. The new Casino planet is used solely to insert some animal rights and anti-capitalism agenda that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever within the universe. It is claimed that evil people get rich by selling weapons to the First Order. However, a later scene reveals they also sell weapons to the Resistance which completely contradicts the earlier message: if weapons dealers want to get rich by selling to both sides, they would want to prevent the weaker side from losing. This means that they would in this case be on the side of the Resistance, at least temporarily. The freeing animal scene is equally shallow; it carries the viewpoint of a child. Free the animals and they will live happily ever after. Except that they cannot survive outside of captivity and their caretakers will take all the blame and having to clean up the mess. This is horrible writing and a catastrophically misguided moral message.A similar example of horrible writing occurs during the space chase that takes place in parallel. There is a conflict between two characters that exists solely because one of them doesn\\'t share an obvious plan for ensuring survival with the other for no reason at all. I have read all sorts of misguided defences for this, but they all fall foul: when finally, the plan is revealed everybody agrees it is a good plan. This is called an \"Idiot plot\" and is a known fallacy in writing, except maybe in a comedy where everybody is allowed to be an Idiot. This is Star Wars. Stop it, Rian, just stop!New force powers are invented whenever it suits some superficial notion of aesthetics that the director has in mind. This is bad for several reasons: it stretches the notion of what the force can do to the point that it seems just like magic. Combine this with the utterly humiliating and incompetent portrayal of villains in this movie and thick plot armour and every sense of looming danger is eradicated. On top of that we have an all-powerful heroine with absolutely no flaws at all. Never does she need rescuing like Luke needed dozens of times in the OT, never is she tempted by the dark side, and never does she make any serious mistake whatsoever. It would not be far-fetched to imagine Rey snipping her Fingers, and suddenly all First Order war machines fall apart. Or she mind-tricks General Hux into the ordering to disband his army or whatever. Then she defeats Kylo Ren single-handedly and also saves Finn Poe etc. Their plot armour makes sure nobody is harmed. Sounds horrible? I think it\\'s better than the plot of this movie. More importantly, the Force mechanics established in this movie ensure that this is all quite possible. There seems to be no sense of \"reality\", of a shared universe with universal rules like in the OT any more. Anything the writers want is suddenly \"magically\" possible with no reason given at all. Again, this completely destroys any sense of immersion or emotional investment and also damages past movies. Clearly, an incompetent bunch of cowards like the First Order would never get to any kind of position of power in a universe that follows and form of logic. Was Tarkin incompetent? Vader? The Emperor? Boba Fett? Imperial Generals? Clearly, they weren\\'t. They set up traps for our heroes who escaped by the narrowest of margins and often depended on others for saving. Respecting villains and giving them dignity ensured that the perceived threat to the heroes was real. In this movie, they are a bunch of cartoonish thugs who at best are mildly annoying. Captain Phasma is mishandled, yet again. Snoke is poorly treated. Kylo Ren does make for an interesting character by virtue of being torn and by Adam Drivers strong performance. This goes against Luke\\'s reasoning that he cannot be redeemed however, so one of the best characters of the movie is undermined by its nonsensical plot. Kylo Ren is also weaker than Rey in any comparison, further diminishing him being a threat.The complete flawlessness of Rey is a common critique, and many call her a \"Mary Sue\" for it. The actress, Daisy Ridley thinks this critique is sexist and would not be wielded against male characters. This may be true of the term, as it refers to a woman in a derogatory sense. It is however fatal to assume that we cannot criticise female characters for having - well - no character flaws I guess. This is absolutely JJ Abrams and Rian Johnston\\'s fault by the way. Regardless of what you call it, Rey being good at everything without having to go through any kind of learning process, and without any kind of failure is a problem (both Luke and Anakin failed and had to be saved by others many times).Rey\\'s overpowered character also makes this movie extremely sexist, if you think about it for a moment. One of the worst outcomes of oppression of women is denying them access to education and personal development. Patriarchist societies deny them access to good schools and close them off from society by forcing them to stay at home, yet they admire them for innate and unearned qualities such as good looks. Think about the morals of Rey being good at everything despite not having to work for it. Yes, she is a strong female character, but she carries a terrible message for women: that overcoming adversity and being allowed (!) to fail and getting away with it is for men only: and that women are only as good at traits that are largely innate to them. This is horrible. Research has established that women try less hard and give up earlier in the face of adversity when tested together with men (but not when among only women). This is widely accepted as evidence of them internalising that \"men are better at overcoming adversity\". This movie reinforces this toxic stereotype and hence does a disservice to female role models.There is nothing I look forward to, frankly, after this Star Wars instalment from Disney. I will not watch Episode IX except when it comes out on Netflix (maybe, just to see how bad it is).',\n",

       " 'Coming from a background where the Star Wars franchise had developed such a strong and positive reputation, makes one begin to contemplate the direction the most recent Star Wars films are headed.From fast paced space battles to intense lightsaber duels, one is most certainly going to be entertained. The most recent expedition into the Star Wars saga includes many modern visual effects as well as humor- something the earlier films may have lacked. This recent embarkation has left many fans in \"awe\" and others in a raging dispute.Recent Twitter and Instagram disputes between fans and the acclaimed Writer/Producer/Director Rian Johnson bring to light the obvious shifts in the general dynamics of the Star Wars films. Most if not all fans highly esteem and claim that the \"Original Series\" from 1977 are the pinnacle and \"gold standard\" of what and how a such a franchise should be represented. Once the \\'Prequels\\' hit the theaters, many fans were repulsed by a certain \"dopey\" character (Jar Jar). Fortunately for the millions if not billions of fans, Jar Jar\\'s role shifted. Certain feelings of negativity towards the prequels as well as \"less than stellar\" acting, created a band-wagon on which many quickly boarded. However regarded the prequels were, the films in and of themselves \"felt\" like a Star Wars film- something the modern day \"adaptations of Star Wars lack.Now... Let me officially begin on The Last Jedi.Unfortunately, the under qualified Writer/Director Rian Johnson interpreted the Star Wars saga to be less than the established \"greatness\" of the franchise. Whether oblivious to the popularity and demands of a Star Wars film or simply a novice \"mistake,\" The Last Jedi lacks all decency a Star Wars film demands and deserves. Most if not all fans are disappointed in the outcome of The Last Jedi. From a storyline with a weak plot to a general feel supporting a recent fad, this film is not a Star Wars movie.Star Wars has created a world where one could leave the troubles reality to a separate world with different struggles. The Last Jedi brings a very feminist approach to the franchise, making the character motives quite embarrassing. No real male role models (unlike the previous 6 films). Story beats off pace and slow. You can almost feel that The Resistance is waiting for the rebels come up with a plan to \"escape.\" A quirky humor is quite evident. Though, this type humor does not belong in film with reputation as this. In Return of The Jedi, Luke is portrayed as hero with strong will to do good. In The Last Jedi, he is quite mopey and does not reflect the type of character as in the earlier films. Those who where once fans of Luke quickly lost interest in his character. WHERE ARE THE EPIC LIGHTSABER DUELS!!! Only one scene in the entire film included a lightsaber duel... With Snoke\\'s guards. Very disheartening for the fan who enjoys a fast paced duel. Johnson quickly turned the fans against rising star Kelly Tran, portraying her as the typical Asian role model (the kind fans strongly dislike). A great disappointment for the actress.Let me conclude on this note. In film school, one learns that when creating a story creating a story, you must have \"set-ups\" and \"pay-offs\" (i.e. Ben Kenobi pulls out a lightsaber for Luke - set-up, He activates the lightsaber - pay-off and even later there is a duel between Ben and Vader (something fans have never seen before)). If a pay-off matches that of the audience, the audience is bored and the film is quite predictable. If the pay-off is greater than what the audience is thinking, the audience is engaged and quickly attaches themselves emotionally to the film. The pay-offs in the Last Jedi don\\'t exceed the audiences expectations. They simply fall short. A note to Disney. All Disney films are produced \"in-house.\" No outsiders. Resulting from that are wonderful stories that we see in theaters. Lucasfilm, however, poorly chose the one to write and direct The Last Jedi. Most if not all fans around the world feel that Rian Johnson is an \"Outsider\" and is not fit for the positions he has been mounted. Unfortunately, this reflects poorly on Disney.',\n",

Acting is good all round, casting- very below par... for visuals, music and effects it is a 5/10... for story and dialogue, character/set/vehicle design... it's a 2/10.

Plot points, changing the rules, boring new cast, killing of the old cast, creating interesting characters just to kill them of again.I knew this movie would be bad before I saw it, but I thought it was a little worse then the movie before. The only thing I needed to see for this movie for it to be acceptable was some awesome overpowered Luke Skywalker action. So at this point I have seen the most of the movie and thought it was kind of boring, weird and even a bit depressing. Luke had been out of character but now he steps up in front on an army and I thought: \"Hell year, this is what I have been waiting for the entire movie!\"Then he gets bombarded and stands without a scratch. Awesome! Now I thought he would kill the entire army, or just some of it at least, showing he is the most powerfull Jedi. Was I dissapointed.. He was just a hologram and even dies afterwards. The movie is called \"The last Jedi\", could we get some action from that last Jedi instead of this... I have no words.',\n",

None of them was good , seems they just played without to want!Disney starts to destroy Star Wars Universe with Force Awakens , with this film just finish it!

I'm done with Star Wars now, Disney is going to keep churning this crap out forever but they are not getting any more of my money.BTW how the hell is is this abomination 7.3 on IMDB? Most reviews I have read has trashed the hell out of it, has Disney put the squeeze on here?\",\n",

There are some clever camera shots, and I liked Leia\\'s scenes especially, but the writing and editing is terrible, and the plot is nonsensical and downright stupid. Phantom menace might actually be a better-made movie, Jar-Jar notwithstanding. Seriously. Characters utter lines deeply anti-thetical to their whole personality in the service of \"new-ness\". Scenes are cut so roughly characters board and exit enemy ships with no explanation how. There are long sub-plot elements that go absolutely nowhere except into cgi hell. People have been way too easy on this trainwreck. Rogue One was what everyone was hoping Last Jedi would be. Not hopeful about Rian Johnson\\'s Star Wars...worse than Lucas so far. Seriously.',\n",
       " 'Okay so, I have been letting this ruminate in my thoughts since the movie came out. I watched it twice, and disliked it both times. I hated it so much the first time I watched it that I sat for about half of the movie, with my arms crossed just waiting for it to be over (probably way too overdramatic but oh well) Let\\'s get to the brass tax here. I am a huge film buff. So when I look at movies and critique them, I look at them from technical elements, to the structure and and all the other great stuff that makes a good film. This movie is not that. I love Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars film, but (in my opinion) one of the best films ever made. So watching this movie I had both my love of film and Star Wars going at the same time. The Star Wars fan in me really dislikes this movies for several reasons. Number One, because Luke says that everyone can use the Force, and that you don\\'t have to be special to use it, VASTLY undermines his story in the OT. The whole point of him understanding how to use the Force is so critical to the story. His main motivation to leave Tatooine is so he can become a Jedi. His story from a literary standpoint is called \"The Heroes Journey\" which is so vital to his character. This movie takes his whole story and throws it out the window with that one line. This bothered me so badly. Luke Skywalker is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. His story is so perfectly crafted in those first films. I could write a book on how great his story is. Anyway, this also sweeps everything Yoda taught him under the rug. Yoda says \"Life creates it, makes it grow. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.\" The Force is bigger than anyone in the universe, that\\'s why only certain people can tap into it. THATS THE POINT. ITS A CALL TO ACTION, TO MOTIVATE THE CHARACTERS INTO ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH THEIR LIVES. So the Last Jedi is telling me now that ANYONE can use it?? What??? Secondly, I hate how this just doesn\\'t have almost any payoffs from the Force Awakens. I don\\'t necessarily care that Snokes true identity is never revealed, I liked that! It would have been dumb to keep him anyway because he would have just been another Palpatine. I liked that they just said that Rey\\'s parents were just random junkers. That makes her even more of an anomaly because she has no genetic connection to the Force, which would have made it even cooler that she can control it and made her special. But they ruined that now but saying anyone can use it. There\\'s so much wasted opportunity in this movie. Anyway, my last point (before this gets too long, because I could go on for awhile) they should have had Rey and Kylo become a team. They could take down the First Order that way and completely ridden it of its existence in the universe. But no. They have to have a big fight scene on a random planet somewhere a half and hour after the movie should have ended. I can say I did like some things about the film. There\\'s no denying that this film has a beautiful look to it. The cinematography is excellent! I liked how the Throne Room looked and that scene was great. I liked the chemistry between Finn and Rose. I liked Rose until she made the dumbest decision ever at the end. The structure of this movie is a mess though. Nobody accomplishes anything. The editing was weird, and every single piece of comedy fell flat for me, except for one in the beginning with C-3P0. I\\'m sorry for rambling and I\\'m sure no one will read this but I just really needed to get this all out.',\n",

My disbelief at such drivel, walking out the cinema was palpable.To be fair the first 10 minutes was good &amp; the last 20 minutes too, so about half an hour of this bloat was worth watching.I could almost have accepted it if it wasn't a savage attack on Luke Skywalker one of mine &amp; cinemas favourite heroes, there isn't actually any good reason that he doesn't turn up in person at the end. If he dies anyway. What I expected - a rip roaring adventure, starring Rey, Poe &amp; Finn with some cool support from Leia, Luke, Chewy. Almost none of these characters come out well from this film, and some shoehorned in ones take up a ridiculous amount of plot space. In the deleted scenes apparently there was one where you saw Luke reacting sadly to Han Solos passing - there wasn't room for this in the final cut. Just think about that for a minute.Apparently the critics loved this I can see why, but really they are pathetic for trending reviewing.Imagine if there had been some real guts to the film, lots of things could have been possible. Finn could have died that might have been a big moment, Rey could have joined the dark side? &amp; maybe Kylo become a Light side Jedi?If diversity filming is the way forward, why not have Finn &amp; Poe fall in love? For me attack of the Clones is the worst star wars film &amp; this only slightly betters this.\",\n",

It goes to great lengths to mock and insult all that made the Star Wars saga special -- the heros, the Jedi, the Force, and the main characters. In this movie Luke Skywalker becomes a hobo drinking from a sea cow (not joking), Princess Leia becomes a space traveling Mary Poppins (not joking), all prior Star Wars principles and principals are thrown to the wayside, and even heroes introduced in the prior episode, Poe and Finn, are turned into bungling stooges.

Currently 7.4 rating, IMDB, you are having a laugh!Disney has ruined Star Wars and only cares about money now.

       " \"This movie is bad for many reasons. I'll list the things I find the most distressing about the movie.1. Bad character writing. Any fiction writer will tell you that authors have to know their characters intimately. When characters are acting in ways that are against their nature the story isn't believable and it feels insincere. This mistake is being made in all parts of this movie. It is the movie's biggest flaw2. Rian Johnson didn't know how to write strong characters. He tries to create strong characters in two ways. First he weakens characters who were once truly strong in the canon. This doesn't make the new characters strong, they only seem strong in comparison. The other way he writes bad strong characters is by making them relatively flawless like Rey. If a character doesn't struggle they're not relateable.3. It's preachy. It seems like Rian Johnson is trying to shove progressive politics in our faces. Star Wars has always been about diversity and equality without making out front and center.4. Rian Johnson burned everything to the ground. I don't think the series can be finished with just one movie.5. There is no continuity with the Force Awakens. Many plot lines established I the Force Awakens were abondoned in the Last Jedi.6. Worst of all is that this movie is a big F.U. To all the fans. Rian Johnson purposely defied pretty much every expectation of the fans. Ever since the release Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have been lambasting the Star Wars fan base. If it weren't for the fans the prequel movies would have never been made. If not for the fans Disney would not have bought Lucasfilm. It's evident that the fans are not happy with this movie by the fact that this movie has underperformed in every way. The fans are Lucasfim's main customers. You have to Serve your customers.  In my opinion this movie should be struck from the canon and remade.\",\n",
       " 'Avoided spoilers and theories as much as possible coming in to this movie. No reviews, nothing to shape my expectations except 1 trailer. I was stunned on how bad the writing was and at certain points I just stared at the screen in disbelief. Only reason I watched the whole movie was because I hope it would do a rogue one and get awesome in the end but sadly it just wrecked the entire star wars universe even more!! Only reason people can delude themselves in to this being a good movie is because of the huge budget this movie had. If you just downgrade the music and visuals a tiny notch people would start hating this movie instead of get blinded by it. It looks good, it sounds good and the actors are good so if you turn off your brain completely you might see it as an average movie at best. Unlimited money and the Star Wars brand will ensure that no matter if the movie itself is good or bad. But the story is non existent, the script is horrible and there is no logic to almost anything. If they had just taken at random any fan fiction that begins at the end of Force Awakens and put this enormous amount of cash towards making it real it would for sure be better than this crap.',\n",
       " \"It has it's moments, but unfortunately everytime it was about to turn interesting, some stupid, ill timed attempt at humor totally ruined it for me.

And don't get me started on the porgs, or Luke's personality change, or Phasma, or Del Toro's character, etc. etc.On the plus side, it's beautifully shot for the most part and it wasn't as predictable as The Force Awakens.\",\n",

This movie spent most of it's time destroying what was established in episode 7 and didn't spend any time on developing future plot development. Where do they go from here? There's nothing to get excited about for episode 9....... I feel devoid and empty after seeing this movie.

There are three scenes in this movie that made me go WTF in the theater and one of them has to do with Carrie Fisher's Leia in the first part of this film. Andy Serkis' Snoke is a wasted character in this movie, he could have been a great villain for this whole trilogy and....then useless.

I\\'ll just keep re-watching the end of ROTJ. Luke will always be the hero archetype and nothing that Disney does will change that for me.

This movie is filled with awful jokes, prequel levels of bad dialogue, and flat-out disappointing twists.The plot focuses around an over abundance of conveniences, everything just happens when it needs to and characters do very little outside of dump exposition at each other. The CGI, most notably on Snoke, is quite bland, and there are plenty of scenes that had me cringing and sighing while the rest of the audience laughed and cheered.The Porgs are really damn annoying, and appear in seemingly every shot on the island where Luke Skywalker resides. You can hear them sqwarking all the time, making fairly nice looking shots and themes look silly. The way they are shoehorned into this movie so clearly for the purpose of children's merchandise its pretty saddening. They aren't cute, and unlike the Gungans or Ewoks, they don't even do anything of value. I don't even like the Gungans or Ewoks.This film clearly tries something new and original, but I think the prequels had already proved people don't like that. I believe Rian Johnson is a bad writer, and a worse director, I haven't enjoyed a single film he's directed, and I seriously can't imagine what Disney saw in him when finding people to helm a movie like this.I legitimately can't even believe how disappointed I am in this movie. I've had so much faith in the new trilogy, The Force Awakens was flawed but good.This? Disney just doesn't know what to do. They aren't developing the characters, and the story keeps going backwards in places.The biggest reveal of the movie is pathetic and unsatisfactory.\",\n",

       " 'I love Star Wars, always did. I\\'m sad to say The Last Jedi, was terrible. The story was really bad. I didn\\'t recognize the characters from Force Awakens. The new Star Wars movies I\\'ve seen more as free Star Wars movies, rather than belonging to the original first three movies. The last jedi was bad as a sci-fi movie generally, and terrible as a Star Wars. Actually I was so upset the night I got home from the movie, that I had trouble sleeping. Here are a few things I felt was just awful. 1. Po jokes with Hugs, making the Empire look like something from Space balls. It wasn\\'t fun, just ridiculous.2. Po attacks the Empire fleet all by himself without being shot down. The scene makes the empire into clowns.3. Snoke makes fun of Kylo Rens helmet. The helmet was really awesome and making the Kylo Ren character great. Kylo destorys it in the beginning of the movie, why? It was so cool we had a new masked \"Vader character\", obviously Rian Johnsson didn\\'t feel the same way. 4. BB-8 becomes a robot to always save the day, and a kind of Macgyver robot which can do everything.5. Amiral Ackbar dies for no reason at all. This great character erazed for what? 6. The library of Jedi knights? What on earth is that? Lots of scriptures that Yoda makes clear is totally useless. Why are they trying to make a religion out of the force?7. The purple haired lady controls a gigantic spaceship by herself? Giving her life for the rebellion, which only gives you the feeling of \"who cares?\". Who is that character? There is no background story to make it interesting.8. The casino city does nothing to the story. 9. Snoke dies... who was he? And he dies way too easy. I quess he never was that powerful ... ? 10. Killing off great characters, making it hard to make a good sequel.11. Where do all rebells go in the end. Suddenly just a few are left. Where did all the other go?12. Why did the whole rebel fleet consist of \"bombers\"?13. Po doesn\\'t care at all the many lives among the rebels lost because of him. Makes him a total a**hole. He wasn\\'t like that in Force Awakens! There he was an hero.14. Why did the codebreaker give back a necklace worth a fortune. Doesn\\'t go with his character.15. The empire can\\'t catch one rebel ship with their whole fleet. The empire seems totally incompetent.16. Leia flies in space and suddenly gets superpowers.17. BB-8 shoots casino markers at enemies, makes the movie look like a comedy.18. Luke\\'s out of character19. Luke dies without any reason.20. Finn\\'s a coward trying to flee from the rebel ship. That wasn\\'t the same Finn we saw in Force Awaken. 21. Trying to make a romantic story between Rose and Finn failes. Why? Because there is no build up at all. 22. Many people have said that the scene where Kylo and Rey fought together against the praetorian guards was great, but I like to tell you why I think it sucked. Kylo had just killed Snoke right? Is it realistic that the guards would then attack Kylo and Rey? Isn\\'t it more likely that they would have run away, since their high leader Snoke just got killed by them. Wouldn\\'t they be thinkning: \"If they could kill Snoke this easy, then we got no chance at all, let\\'s run for it.\" Their leader, their \"god\" did just die, wouldn\\'t that cause some kind of confusion and fear among them? That\\'s a few of the reasons why I feel The Last Jedi was crap. I give it 3 stars.

It was a completely goofy conversation that felt like a video game cut scene.Luke on the island is weird, never really gets explained properly, or maybe I just don\\'t accept the reason, but whatever. There\\'s a hokey scene where Rey is following Luke during his daily activity. He drinks the milk from some giraffe creature with a deranged look on his face, the giraffe creature looks at Rey as if it feels violated, and Rey looks away uncomfortable. The whole scene felt like something grotesque that I shouldn\\'t be seeing.Dialogue is awful. When Rose (UGH) \"saves\" Finn, she says something along the lines of \"we\\'ll win not by fighting those we have, but by saving those we love.\" Multiple people in the theater legitimately groaned and then we all started laughing. Also, the droids barely are in it. Chewie is barely in it. The movie misses the mark with regards to Star Wars charm.

That is non existent in this movie. Snoke is the sith lord, and he gets cut in half, there is no epic battle, there is no subtle manipulation. Snoke cant even be considered a sith lord because he was the most weak and pathetic thing that ever existed. And Cry-lo Ren cant stop weeping uncontrollably. Hes still a whiny emo kid.

If not for one thing, but related to James Cameron\\'s comment in the beginning of my review.No interest in Solo movie, definitely no interest in EP9 with Abrahms back again and definitely no interest in Rian\\'s trilogy.I can rewatch all of the Lucas\\'s 2 trilogies over and over ....don\\'t know how many times I have seen EP V, and enjoy each time as much as the first....this is a rare thing. TFA I cannot watch, the more I see it the more upset I get....The last jedi is the smae....The last Jedi is the 1st SW I have seen on first go, that I dislike from the outset....Even TFA I liked first watch only, but could not stomach repeat viewings...',\n",

It would run up a thesis of 3 volumes!I will not put spoilers but Disney should outsource SW to someone with imagination and a genuine knowledge of the SW universe.It is pathetic, how they are treating legends of SW and how they are introducing new ones, if there are any.The script could have been written better if given to a high Bollywood director who just had 1 ton of tequila. Yes that bad.I feel sorry for Mark Hamill agreeing to this scrip, no wonder Harrison Ford wanted to get killed in the first place.Bottom line, I disagree with everything in the movie. the script, the acting, the plot, the fights (OMG if there are any!!!! reminded me of kung fu panda) and the final outcome!I don\\'t know who to pity more: those who wrote the script with a 5 years old imagination or those acting with a smug face that tells you \"I can\\'t believe I\\'m in a SW movie!.',\n",

       " 'I was truly disappointed with this film, I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember.This film almost seemed designed to ruin the legacy that George Lucas left with the originals. For starters, the fact that they had a side quest that took up half an hour of the film is taking the piss, and the fact that it\\'s only purpose was to tell us that capitalism and animal cruelty was totally unnecessary.The way that they handled the characters from the original trilogy was criminal, they killed off Admiral Ackbar like he was just a background character. Having never seen Princess Leia use the force, I was surprised to see her not only survive in space, but to also then fly back to the ship basically unharmed. Meet Princess Leia Poppins everyone. And last but not least we have Luke Skywalker, a character who saw good in Darth Vader, but will attempt to kill his nephew because he thinks that he will turn the the dark side is just ludicrous. The fact that they had time to show him milking an alien and yet no time to show emotion is simply ridiculous, and then have him beaten by someone who has only held a lightsabre twice seems like a total waste of time.When the head of Lucasfilm was asked what she wanted to do with a new trilogy, her response was \"The main character has to be female\". I have no problem with a female led Star Wars film. I however do have an issue with Rey, she has no character development, has only used a lightsabre once and yet is now the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy. Finn does pretty much nothing throughout the film apart from kill Captain Phasma and then nearly himself. Poe destroys a Dreadnought in the beginning of the film (I know that it was Rose\\'s sister) and is then sidelined by Admiral Holdo for the rest of the film.The addition of Laura Dern to the cast excited me, that was until her character turned up and consequentially added an additional hour to the film and then kills herself in a role that was befitting of a good character. Snoke had the makings of an excellent villain, and then is killed off halfway through the film. Kylo Ren seemed to have a cool story ahead of him, but then this film happened and he was reduced to just another crying emo kid that like to show how swole he is.And onto the worst character in the film, Rose does nothing through the film but say stupid things and bring us to canto byte.Captain Phasma was a waste of time being given that she is only in the film for about two minutes and is then killed off.The film is also riddled with false humour which ultimately makes the film even worse.',\n",
       " 'How should I describe this movie without feeling a traumatic headache at the end..?As I write this review, 6 months have already passed so I will not consider anything written as a spoiler at this point in time.The Last Jedi was a horrible movie by and large in every aspect of movie making. In this review, I will describe the different movie directing and editing aspects, as well as the story aspects.Sound editing: the sound was horribly edited, where at many points of the movie scenes that should have the music feel more grave and sombre, the music was in fact mild and unemotional. This is of course not the fault of the music artist (as John Williams is still amazing in his musical talent) but rather the director\\'s fault for wanting it to be bland.During many periods of whispering discussions in the movie, the whispers were overshadowed by the musical atmosphere. Although not really perceivable in the theatres, this issue is actually apparent when watching it at home. The problem is due to bad sound gain levels choice.Special Effects: Although there some scenes where the special effects are nicely done, there are only very few of them. We find ourselves most of the time witnessing unfinished work. Many scenes showed us a mid-rough work, such as the scene of Leia in space. We can also see several scenes where the background looked like 2D cardboards behind the protagonists (Finn &amp; Rose at Casino, specially while running from danger mounted on the animal they helped free).Even though such a scene was also rough on the Original Trilogy, in this day and age, with our perfected technologies, it shouldn\\'t be as such anymore.Directing: the movie\\'s overall directing is far below average (and I mean crushingly below). The choices made by the movie Director were thoroughly disappointing. Where JJ Abrams, director of The Force Awakens, gave many possibilities to create character development and lore development, Rian Johnson, The Last Jedi\\'s director, decided to throw everything JJ put in place into the trash bin. Rian Johnson\\'s choices were made out of laziness and the personal need to save budget money. Every single moment where the characters could\\'ve gotten a great development, Rian Johnson decided that it was too much of a hassle for him to even bother to try and so instead he chose the easy answer, by giving no back story mysteries to the characters or even a grain of evolving insight to the characters (which would later have probably been a great opportunity to develop on either another movie or a book). Parallel to these, the misuse of everyone\\'s beloved Jedi, Luke Skywalker, was saddening. Mark Hamill played his character to his best, and marvelously so, considering the disappointing turn of personality Rian Johnson gave him. Among the choices made by the director that were disappointing was the unending and boring space chase scenes, where the First Order, following closely behind the Resistance\\'s main spaceship and transports, were barely doing anything to take down their hated enemies. The lack of a TIE armada shooting the Resistance ships and the lack of Resistance fighters defending the transports and motherships is dismaying.There are also errors in the movie that are painfully obvious, such as Leia not freezing over in space, or even right after, the lack of vacuum when she reenters the ship through the opening door, a weapon suddenly disappearing from the screen during the praetorian fight scene, Luke not wanting to be found, yet in the previous episode a map was made to show his location (yet another line of storytelling Rian Johnson didn\\'t care to take into account), an impossible heirloom (golden dices) that stays after Luke\\'s death, Luke\\'s Prosthetic hand disappears with him. And these are just to name a few among myriads of errors, showing yet again the director\\'s lack of care and laziness.Supreme Leader Snoke was tossed in the bin as well. This is also part of Rian Johnson\\'s choice to not have to put up with the work of developing the character. Not even adding a tiny dust of indication of where he comes from or what he is or whom he really is. And frankly, the viewers were not waiting for a whole background but just a tiny bit of indication. Adding to the mystery.In choices of emotion, Rian completely rejected the idea of showing Luke mourning for Han\\'s death. It was learned through Mark Hamill in an interview that Rian Johnson said that he didn\\'t have time to shoot such a scene, saying it is unimportant and will hurt the pacing. Yet they spent a large amount of money and time to film Luke Skywalker milking a type of alien sea cow, and drink the blue liquid. An illogical choice from the director\\'s part. Illogical if you don\\'t consider it a way to say \"I\\'m mocking you\". The pacing could also have been done thanks to musical gravity and transition to Kylo Ren. On the other hand, Rian Johnson seems pretty happy to show a childish reaction in Rose wanting to liberate the animals used in track races from Canto Bight.Perhaps the only wonderful moment in the movie is Luke and Leia seeing each other towards the end. It was the only moment that actually was fine.In terms of diversity, the movie shows an overpopulation of Human protagonists and crew. Rian Johnson has no care at all for Humanoid Sentient beings from outer space, and decides only to show very few in this movie. This seems to show that the universe is only filled with Humans. Our species, our Race. In a Galaxy far far away where a massive amount of different Humanoid Beings exists.In terms of human diversity Rian Johnson put in a limited amount, enough to satisfy maybe Human diversity parameters in a movie, but still pales in comparison to the prequels. And the diverse humans are barely used in an epic characterization where they would be given very important aptitudes. Mostly they fumble and stumble during the many scenes of the movie. Dialogues are bland and uninteresting, and seems to be just lazy rambling to fill the minutes (except for very few 1 minute exceptions where it is a serious matter), most dialogues seem to feel like emo moments, especially when Rose is in play.The humor in this movie is equally bland. The humor doesn\\'t mix well with the music, the atmosphere or even sometimes borders the cartoonish. In addition to that, Rian Johnson has just stuffed the movie with humor making the movie completely lose its seriousness and erases entirely the story\\'s somber/grave atmosphere.Rian Johnson in this movie proves himself to be quite a copycat artist. Not only the movie is about 70% a mixture of episode 5 and 6, but scenes where he declared on interview that were his own original ideas turned out to be just exact ideas and turnouts from other older movies. For example, Leia flying through space was taken from Mary Poppins and Luke\\'s supposed Force Projection was a complete copy, beat for beat, of Kurt Russell in Escape from L.A.Story wise, we have just about everything wrong for this movie to even be called Star Wars, it has no essence of Star Wars, no soul of Star Wars, no mysteries of Star Wars. It is only Star Wars because it is in space and uses bad guys and good guys group similar from Originals, but with different names, only the known characters keep their names.The plot is boring to a point of disgust, and has no logic as a continuation of the previous. In fact, it seems to be completely oblivious of the previous installment. Luke leaving a map to pinpoint him but saying he doesn\\'t want to be found, a Rey who needs only a couple minutes of training compared to the Original Trilogy where Luke is in Dagobah and it is implied that he is there for a certain amount of days or weeks, and even then he only mastered the basics. Rian fails to show a Rey that is challenged by learning, and instead is given total mastery of the Force without a single real effort except that of learning to feel the Force for the first time. She also masters combat skills without learning which is an impossible thing to happen, even with the Force.In this movie, we witness the appearance of subplots that are painfully unconvincing and are pretty much useless.A large part of the movie is a mix of the two last movies of the Original Trilogy, yet with a quality far below any movie average and of course far below the Originals.In conclusion, The Last Jedi is a horrible and unending disappointment. A complete fail for a Star Wars movie. It is unimaginative, underworked, uncaring, unappreciative, unmoving and soulless. We can only conclude that the director is untalented, negatively deceptive, lazy and insulting. His work gives the impression that he hasn\\'t left his school, that his homework is only an accumulation of copy paste from different pages he found on the internet, that he is someone who would just learn the minimum required to pass a mock test and that he is a young anarchist giving no importance to respect and good conduct. An uneducated person.The Joker he is not, because even that character in the DC universe has a lot more personality, style and cunning.A, sadly, very bad follow up to an already doubtful and wavering first sequel (Episode 7). One that will be nearly impossible to save from further disaster.',\n",
       " 'Some of the praise, at least from the fans is because of the deviation from Star Wars tradition which, honestly, I have an issue with out the door. We are watching it because we want to see a Star Wars film.And the deviation from Star Wars tradition seems especially ridiculous given how hard it tries--like The Force Awakens--to rely on nostalgia to keep the fans that felt alienated when Rey turned out to be, well, absolutely flawless, absolutely loved and trusted by absolutely everyone, and faced no real challenges or struggles......so, bank on nostalgia because giving the primary character a real literary struggle to add to a sense of character and plot is still seemingly out of the question.And that kind of seems like a troupe now days of characters that are diverse for the state of diversity. It seems like their creator and political fans feel that adding any struggle for said character to overcome would somehow take away from the political importance of the character.And that holds true for The Last Jedi. Rey still has no real struggles that can create even the slightest bit of dramatic tension for the audience. It is understood that she is the best and can easily overcome anything the story throws at her...and she does. And that is the reason her character is rejected by fans. It doesn\\'t make for good cinema. Skywalker had the same issues in I-III, but at least it was understood that he was going to fail at the end of his story arc only to be redeemed in Luke\\'s.Rey is still so perfect there is no dramatic tension where she is involved.But, don\\'t let that be the only thing that kills it for you. Poe\\'s initial radio play with the new faux Empire sets the entire movie up for one long eye roll. Those jokes seemed so out of place for science-fiction that it killed the movie from the start.But then the bad humor of your lame aunt that only think\\'s she\\'s funny is also a new troupe for movies for movies like this.So the films have to rely on nostalgia to market it to fans of the last two trilogies...and in this case it doesn\\'t really work. The nostalgia is more along the lines of \"Remember when Luke Skywalker was a thing\" variety. The sort of nostalgia that references the old beloved franchise, without really understanding the dynamic of it.They did the same \"Remember when this happened\" nostalgic ploy in The Force Awakens and, like then they didn\\'t have the background and understanding to pull it off. Solo wasn\\'t really the cynical untrusting scoundrel that made him so beloved. And in this one Luke isn\\'t the whiny flawed but blindly moral hero that gets in over his head.The result is a nostalgia that is just an empty reference. A nostalgia that has no real idea what it is referencing, or at least not one that runs any deeper than the surface.So the jokes don\\'t land.So hero doesn\\'t struggle and......the film has no real drama because of the lack of struggle.So the nostalgia is only skin deep and......it results in a nostalgia that is more of an insult to the older fan base that it tries to appeal to.Disney didn\\'t listen to the fans that complained about The Force Awakens. They were too busy calling them names for not loving the film. All the fans wanted was a story, that is all, they wanted a struggle, they wanted real drama. They wanted the characters they loved to be the characters they loved.What they got instead was a character easily walks into every situation and beats every adversity with ease still...despite that being the main complaint.What they got was old heroes acting like different people again.What they got was another bad movie.',\n",

Character motivations are practically non-existent or are so horribly shallowly explained they don't resonate at all, and the force is now basically a deux ex machina where characters can pull force powers of hitherto unseen or unheard of strengths out of nowhere simply to facilitate the plot - or get the writer out of a sticky situation. Add to that a subplot that goes nowhere and means nothing, simply to have specific characters in a specific location at a specific time, and you've got nothing short of a contrived mess of a script.This is a shame as this movie has a lot of potential and with a better thought out script could have been really good.Now I can only feel for the poor people who has to make a conclusion to this mess.With all that said, I did find it entertaining, but only when I shut my brain off...\",\n",

Holdo's motivations were.....well, we never learn them except that it seems she just wanted to talk down to Poe. The entire Canto Byte storyline was 100% useless and made no impact on the story except to bash capitalism and virtue signal about animal rights. Luke's entire character was nothing like we knew of him from the OT, and we were given no real reason for his drastic change into a winy, grumpy old man. This movie was horrible. Force Awakens was enjoyable and fans spent two years guessing about a few key issues and what would come of them. This movie totally tossed those questions and subjects aside to go off on useless tangents that were neither entertaining nor relevant to the outcome of the story. Disney Star Wars needs new leadership, some true fans of the source material. Look how Marvel is going about things...not only having competent directors who are also FANS of the comics, but listening to the average fan and applying that to how they handle the characters and stories.

Rey's parents, the Knights of Ren, Kylo's obsession with Vader, Snoke's origin, Phasma basically worthless and it's all either unanswered or resolved in a completely underwhelming fashion.

No to mentions that the plot inherently sucks to begin with for this movie. These massive star destroyers can't hold them in a tractor beam? Something done in a New Hope? Seems like an easy tactical solution. Nope. The characters are just bad. Luke has been completely gutted and turned into a passive, cowardly sociopath. Rey continues to be a Mary Sue, but it's dialed up to eleven this time. The Force ghost of a beloved character (Yoda) shows up to basically tell Luke Rey doesn't need him and he can't teach her anything. I wish I was making this up. It's honestly ridiculous. Coincidentally, Yoda is also turned into a cackling lunatic. Finn and the new character Rose have a pointless romance and a filler plotline. Only Kylo Ren has some serious decent character development as his fall to the Dark side is explored but then undone in the final scene with Luke as he turns into a comic book villain with no tactics or thoughtful villainy, if that's a word. It's like a poorly executed rehash of the Obi and Anakin dual without the backstory. Not to mention that he basically needed help in every battle sequence which again takes away any of the good stuff accomplished character arc wise. He managed to off Snoke it a comical way, but then gets put into what amounts to a headlock by a royal guard? Seriously? Rey has to save his weak ass? He could stop a laser bolt but couldn't be bothered to do anything remotely badass in this sequence? They left that to Mary Sue but still want the audience to feel like he's somehow a threat.Another thing that struck me was the humor in this episode. It's off the charts and completely out of place. Every other line is a quip, and even serious characters like the old, depressed Luke act like they're in a Marvel movie. It's extremely jarring.Anyone notice that every strong character in this movie was a female? Agenda's anyone? The sacrificial pilot right at the beginning, the purple haired lady that couldn't be bothered to explain a plan because the man (poe) was just too stubborn and hotheaded; read testosterone filled to be reasoned with apparently. Did I mention Mary Sue Rey?How about Super Leia? Seems to me Kathleen Kennedy is making darn sure females are given all the heroic opportunities and the OT males get castrated. I could overlook this overt pc crap had the story honored and expanded on the lore instead of taking a big giant heaping pile of crap on it. The story is basically reset. Nothing in the past matters, and the future is open to any interpretation Disney deems marketable. RIP Starwars 12-14-2017, you had a long run. Overall, this is the worst Star Wars movie.

Sounds like a great material for... everything?Lukes emo character. He tries to save Vader but almost kills an innocent Ben Solo in his sleep.Snoke can\\'t be betrayed, can\\'t be defea.. oops. Snoke was useless. Leaving us there with \"the rule of two\" but without answers.Disney thinks we care about random rebel ships being destroyed and random rebel sacrifices. If they want us to feel sad, sacrifice someone we love.Now lets dig a little deeper.You can turn on a lightsaber with the force now. This changes everything. Think about it.. Why didn\\'t Obi Wan just slice Darth Maul off by the ankles whilst hanging in the pit at the end of Phantom Menace?Why not just turn off your opponents lightsaber mid-swing?(Insert infinite number of other questions here)Thank you for sticking with me with through all the negativity. Lets look at the positive things.+ The Yoda scene was perfection.+ The look and feel of (almost) everything was spot on.+ The sound design was what you might expect from a Star Wars movie.+ Most likely the most visually stunning Star Wars movies ever created. Even if it had some flaws.+ Alot of screen time for Kylo Ren. Adam Driver proves he\\'s a great pick for the role.+ Great action scenes.+ Luke Skywalker\\'s super-jedi-mindtrickFor me personally. The biggest question is: Why should we look forward to the next movie?Now when Kylo Rens/Reys allegiance is sorted out. Snoke is dead. Reys parents are most likely never to be revealed. It didn\\'t leave us on a cliff or wanting more.May the force be with episode IX.Oh by the way, to my surprise.I actually liked the Porgs.',\n",
       " 'Many were waiting for the continuation of the legendary saga \"Star Wars\". They put their hopes on him. And now it came out. Direct continuation of the seventh episode reached the audience, but did it justify expectations?The script of the film is very rich in events. There are many plot lines and actions that play a key role. On the one hand it\\'s good, because the film does not let the viewer get bored, but on the other hand it prevents the film atmosphere from completely being imbued, because the editing very often ends at the most interesting moment. This \"serial\" reception seems not quite to the point, and the film is perceived heavier than we would like. Although in general, the characters were allowed to reveal themselves, with the possible exception of Ray. By the end of the film, it remained the same as it was in the beginning, while other characters developed in one direction or another. Although Daisy Ridley played her character at the highest level, there was still a lack of progress and internal changes in the heroine. The timeline of the film was a record 152 minutes, but they look not so difficult, although during the film very often you are in a tense state due to a large number of twists. All these twists are very well developed, which is amazing. Throughout the movie, you do not know which way the plot will turn, and at some point the film makes you realize that everything will not go as you thought. The episode turned out to be rather gloomy, but nevertheless it included a proprietary Disney humor that was not always there, although jokes were ridiculous. In general, all problems do not reduce the number of positive emotions that you receive from viewing.The director\\'s work of Ryan Johnson has borne fruit. His film turned out to be above the \"Awakening Force\" by Jay Abrams. How does Johnson behind the back of the series \"In all the heavy\", which is undoubtedly one of the best in the world series. And in general, this time, \"Disney\" more responsible approached the continuation of the franchise. To the music of John Williams there are no complaints at all. It perfectly emphasizes the atmosphere of the \"distant-distant galaxy\", which is very pleasing and winds up memories of the old parts. In general, \"The last Jedi\" very much resemble the fifth episode, only with new characters. It\\'s understandable why the studio does it. The young generation, for the most part, does not perceive the first films, so the studio tells the old story with new heroes who may become favorites in the future for the new franchise audience, but they do not forget about the old fans, trying to please them, like JJ Abrams episode, but while they do not quite get it.Actor\\'s work in the new film is also impressive. The line of Kylo Ren in the performance of Adam Driver is very good. Throughout the film, we see how his character develops. Unlike the previous part, in this episode the son of Khan Solo can rightfully be called a full-fledged antagonist, and not a hysterical teenager who very much wants to look like his grandfather Darth Vader, but he does not succeed. Actors \"old man\" Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, too, look quite organic. The images of unbreaked Leah and Luke\\'s lost hope fit perfectly into the plot. Young actors quite deservedly can count on the fact that they will love the new fans, but on all their background I would like to highlight By Dameron in the performance of Oscar Isaac. This brave rebel, who is ready to sacrifice everything, even his own life, for the sake of the \"Resistance\" perfectly figures in the plot of the picture. Although in terms of some characters and the question arises: \"Why are they in the movie?\" - It does not spoil the impression of the acting game. I hope in the future will explain their appearance, otherwise it is unclear why there was a need to include them in the script, if you could do without them. And the High Leader Snowk also failed to live up to expectations. He does not reach the level of the teacher of the Sith, as, for example, Darth Sidious.Special effects and action scenes in the movie are also good, though sometimes they sometimes get tired of them, but still it does not take away the beauty of the film. The picture is full of beautiful frames and it has an elaborate fauna of different planets. To be honest, I really liked the animals that are presented to the film. Make-up and costumes also deserve praise. Thanks to all this, the film looks very nice, and many scenes are perfectly stored in memory because of a good and high-quality picture.Personally, I liked the whole picture with all its problems. Of course, new films have something to strive for, of course. But progress in comparison with the previous part is felt. I hope that \"Disney\" will stick to this path and eventually make a film that can compete with the first six parts.',\n",

I mean, for christ sakes, there were 0 lightsaber duels. Even at the end it builds up to an epic duel and then lets you down.If you, like me, have been excited for months, this is very disappointed.

       " \"Good parts: (1) Porgs (2) Some Luke Skywalker scenes, although his character was virtually unrecognisable from the original trilogy (3) Very good space battles (4) Luke's reunion with Artoo (5) I felt Finn and Poe were more likeable in this movie compared to Force Awakens (6) Most Princess Leia scenes, except where she flies through space (7) Mark Hamill was exceptional. I never wanted him off screen. Bad parts: (1) The dejected feeling I had when the movie finished. As a matter of fact I felt this way about 3/4 into the film. This is obviously subjective but it looks like I'm not alone based on other comments. This is especially the case if you're a fan of the original trilogy. I honestly feel cheated and wonder if the movie was meant to create such emotions in people. (2) The way Johnson wrote Luke. He has always been optimistic and self sacrificing. He would never have even considered killing Ben. He wouldn't have allowed others to suffer while doing nothing. In the 'legends of Luke skywalker' book he is very inquisitive about the Force and it's origins. Yet he doesn't read original scripts while being stuck on an island with nothing else to do. He is a jedi master but is overpowered by Rey in their stick battle- maybe on purpose? He should have spent more time with Chewbacca to console him about losing Han. He uses no force powers, except at the end, and doesn't 'kick butts' like Kennedy said he would. He projects himself to Crait to stand there? It could have been an epic battle between him and the first order. Just show some development in his character!!! The decision to kill him off was absolutely atrocious and series ending for myself. He could have survived the Force projection. Rey will do it in the next film and I'm sure she will be just fine. (3) Rey- I don't mind Rey as a concept and Daisy does a half decent job portraying her, but how is she so powerful? It also appears that she can do no wrong!! In this stage in her development Luke hadn't even moved a noodle with the Force yet! She is extremely naive. She finds a jedi master and then viciously confronts him because Kylo told her something. I would have thought shed be reluctant to believe Kylo in relation to anything. I don't like that she's the last Jedi. It is very contrived and cringe worthy. The explanation of her parents was uninspiring. Had she been a skywalker her force powers would have been somewhat understandable. (4) Artoo- we see him for a brief moment. I wanted to see him and Luke together much longer. Once they're reunited where does Artoo go? Just disappears it seems. BB8, who I like, is conveniently saving the day all over the galaxy. Does Luke understand R2? (5) Leia using force powers to fly through space... (6) killing off snoke with no explanation of his origin. He had been built up to be a great villain and match for Luke.(7) Rey and Kylo scenes together, even though they were apart. Just awful. I've only just seen this movie being a big fan of Star Wars. I didn't mind TFA due mainly to the ending. I thought the 2 movies would make up for Luke's absence in the TFA. Clearly I was wrong. Even if Luke comes back as a force ghost I still won't be going to see episode 9. My best hope are the stand alone films, provided Johnson goes nowhere near them.\",\n",
       " \"Be aware - spoilers ahead.Porgs are cool. The Last Jedi is not. It is very disappointing movie for somebody looking for answers to really anything Star Wars lore. It has some good moments but after The Force Awakens left viewers such a high-note with the return of the Luke Skywalker - I left feeling empty and wondering if they just should have left it all alone.The legend of the rebellion and childhood hero for so many Luke Skywalker is a broken man who unfortunately has not learned too much in his time in exile. Something that really puzzles me here is that there are no new revelations about the force as one would expect, especially by somebody in exile with unlimited time, power and the potential to learn.We're treated to a great performance by Mark Hamill but I wanted Luke Skywalker to be great. He is the hero of the Original Trilogy, by far the most revered and loved and he gets a moment, sure, but it merely serves as an opportunity to 'pass the torch' to the younger cast and it seems so contrived and obvious.This is all made worse by the real-life passing of Carrie Fisher who plays Princess Leia who seems much more comfortable in her role than in The Force Awakens. I must admit I had really high hopes for this film, for nostalgic reasons and as much as I really liked the characters in The Force Awakens it's the original characters who we all fell in love with and seeing them treated like this is - as means to simply pass the torch to younger actors is really disappointing. The Force Awakens did it right with Han Solo because it elevated Kylo Ren's villain status enormously. The problem is that the Rey and Luke dynamic needed to be fleshed out way more. We needed more revelations about the true nature of the force, how it began, something new and we got nothing even though Luke has his hands on the first ever Jedi texts and scrolls, it seems like he hasn't read them because we get absolutely no real insight into what they say. How disappointing is that considering he is in exile? What else has he got to do? I found this totally, utterly frustrating beyond belief.More wasted opportunities lie with some of the characters. Supreme Leader Snoke's characters 'moment' was a shocking but empty. We got no backstory and nothing clever to bind the saga together. He is literally just a 'bad guy' that just appears out of nowhere and corrupts young Ben Solo, aka Kylo Ren.Captain Phasma is another throwaway character with nothing to do at all as is General Hux, who just provides comic relief and then there is Rey's parentage which becomes the ultimate disappointment in this story. Another aspect that just left me feeling empty and unsatisfied. Oscar Isaac's ace pilot Poe Dameron is back and joined by Laura Dern playing newcomer Admiral Holdo. Their story is one of the best side stories that completely pays off. I loved Poe Dameron's energy and enthusiasm in this just like I loved Finn's in The Force Awakens. Unfortunately Finn's journey is far less compelling now. He is joined by actress Kelly Marie Tran who plays Rose Tico and a friendship, possible romance ensues but it's all very cliche and nothing to write home about nor is the much hyped Canto Bight scenes which resemble something more out of a Harry Potter movie than Star Wars.The other dynamic is Rey and Kylo Ren's relationship which does manage to keep you guessing for a time. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are again, really good in their respective roles but it's not enough to save the story from feeling like a lost opportunity to tie the Skywalker story (the Star Wars story we all fell in love with) together in a satisfying package. I think Disney have tried to throw one too many curve balls and they're way off. I remember leaving The Force Awakens with so much optimism and I wish it were different but essentially I feel that there is nowhere else to go. We've left in the middle of the desert without a tank of gas at the conclusion of The Last Jedi.\",\n",

From the writing, to the plot, to the fact that the writer of this movie does not even seem to understand the characters he is writing about, this is the worst excuse for a Star Wars movie ever created. The Last Jedi makes the Ewok movies feel like great cinematic achievements. Starting with Luke Skywalker, the hero of the original series is reduced to an incoherent hermit that won\\'t help a galaxy in need. He is in no way the same character that redeemed Vader. It\\'s not consistent with his character and then his death is so needless that it seems like Rian Johnson just hated the character of Luke and wanted to take a leak on his legacy. Regarding Leia, I have no objections with her showing Force abilities, but the way they utilize those in the movie are beyond ridiculous. Her flying through space like Superman looks insanely stupid and silly. Also, as much as George Lucas was maligned for silly humor in the prequels, TLJ makes those seem serious by comparison. The stupid slapstick and potty humor is more appropriate for an \"American Pie\" film or \"Dude Where\\'s My Car?\" The characters in the movie seem to have next to no motivation in general and are just there. Characters like Snoke seemed to have lots of potential, but this movie cut off all the interesting plot lines from The Force Awakens, and we are left with Force sensitive children with no names sweeping stable floors instead. On a positive note, the action sequences are adequate, but not as impressive as the battle in the original trilogy. The light saber fights are okay, but nothing special. Overall, I recommend this as a Netflix watch only. Rian Johnson has messed things up so badly that he has left JJ Abrams a Herculean task of trying to salvage this steaming turd and make something that approaches a decent conclusion to this trilogy.

This most millennial of movies - preachy, shallow, self satisfied, lazy, boring and nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is - with a whole act that\\'s completely pointless, is chock full of terribly out of place, cartoonish humour and laughably bad dialogue - Luke chose the island because it was \"the most unfindable\" - I kid you not, he actually says that.

       " \"I first need to state that as a Star Wars Fan I'm thrilled to witness all those new sequels,for instance I didn't praise The Force Awakens however I thought back then that rebooting such an old franchise is a hard task, I really enjoyed Rogue One which I'm thinking is maybe one of the best Star Wars movie ever even compared to the first trilogy.So I've been watching this morning and my words can't describe how much of a letdown I think this movie is.The movie is riddled with pranks, bad humour, making fun of the Star Wars universe in a bad way, I usually like humour but here it's not subtle enough.There are lots of realism issues, for instance people surviving in space with no gear, a single stupidly modded X-Wing taking down a Capital ship, I know Star Wars is a fantasy but this is too much.I feel like the new characters are out of place, I don't get them, moreover, they evolve too quickly, adding to the realism issue.Some creatures, items unveiled into this movie don't add any value to it, they're here just to sell more merchandising itemsThe villains on the dark side are ridiculous, a boy and a creature that could play in one of Disney movies, they really don't compare to Vador nor PalpatineParts of the Story don't make any sense, how come Snoke fleet couldn't keep up with resistance fleet rusty ships?? they chased them for like 8 hours, seriously??Moreover it's still recycled from previous Star Wars Movies.Ship design is not on par with the previous movies.\",\n",
       " \"I share Hamill's disapproval regarding the evolution (of rather devolution) of Luke. His self-imposed exile made just about as much sense as Yoda's. In fact, it made even less sense because at least Yoda was acknowledging that he was getting too old to fight the good fight and instead decided to wait for Luke and Leia to grow up. Chances are he felt his time had come because of his old age. (In the originals we didn't even know why Yoda was on Dagobah)Luke's time couldn't possibly had come yet; he was still perfectly capable of continuing the good fight. He would have made a powerful ally to the resistance along with his force sensitive sister (just like in the originals), yet he decided to just.. give up. The son of the chosen one, savior of the galaxy, who resisted the temptations of the dark side, and was risking torture and death for the sake of his father, sister and friends.. just decided to give up on everything. Galaxy is in trouble? Meh. Sister is in danger? Meh. Solo in danger? Meh. That's obviously not who Luke is. Caring is a character trait for interesting characters, we can't have Luke be about that now that we have newer characters to sell. Only a few moments of last minute caring, and that's it!The sentiment that the old has to go in order for the new to shine also is overrated. These people don't have to die to ease the transition between new and old, and you can't just toss Luke away simply because Rey now has to be the new Jedi star. It's kind of disgraceful for Rey because she is an interesting character portrayed by a seemingly skilled and beautiful actress. If you truly wish to remove Luke to make way for Rey then at least give him a more honorable passing.Obi Wan had a perfectly fine passing. Same with Yoda and Vader. Solo's passing in the sequels was a bit meh but acceptable. Luke's passing felt like the studio didn't know how to get rid of him and so just tacked his illusion+suicide combo on in the end. I don't even mind that force illusions now is a thing, it's a cool trick.. but Luke's use of it just felt empty. everyone wanted to see Luke kick ass again, and although some people found the alternative acceptable I sure don't.\",\n",
       " '\\'Star Wars Episode 8: The Last Jedi\\' was very different from any Star Wars film before it, in some ways good, and in some ways bad. It had an interesting story, like pretty much every other \\'Star Wars\\' film, which isn\\'t at all surprising. I was extremely excited walking into \\'The Last Jedi\\', but I left kinda disappointed about certain aspects. I loved seeing the legendary Rebellion hero and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker again, but his death is the main part I was disappointed by. He is one of the most iconic characters in film history, and I feel his end should\\'ve been equally as iconic. I was on the edge of my seat when he showed up on the planet Crait to help the Resistance and him and his former student Ben Solo/Kylo Ren were about to fight. I thought it was going to be the most epic lightsaber duel of all-time, but instead it turned out Luke wasn\\'t even there! He chose to stay on his little island and project a Force-illusion or hologram or whatever you want to call it, instead of showing up in person and facing Kylo like a man. Then he just disappeared and \"died\" like Yoda did in \\'Return of the Jedi\\'. That really rubbed me the wrong way. Even if he knew he was gonna die, why didn\\'t he go to Crait in person and duel Kylo Ren to buy the Resistance even MORE time to escape? Then when they were safely off-world, he could\\'ve done what Obi-Wan did in \\'A New Hope\\': lowered his lightsaber (which technically should\\'ve been his green-bladed one instead of his blue one which had just been broken in half about a scene before), allowed Kylo to strike him with his red lightsaber, and just disappeared, leaving only his robes and lightsaber behind. That would\\'ve been an epic and iconic end for such an iconic character. Anyway, I feel like I\\'m ranting, so I\\'ll move on. The space battle at the beginning was amazing, even though it didn\\'t end well for many Resistance fighters and pilots. There were definitely a lot of deaths in this movie. Luke, Supreme Leader Snoke, Captain Phasma, Vice Admiral Holdo, Rose\\'s sister, and Admiral Ackbar (\"It\\'s a trap!\") all died, which was very sad. I was hoping to learn more about Snoke\\'s backstory because he was shrouded in so much mystery since The Force Awakens, but I guess he just wasn\\'t that important. I got so excited when Kylo Ren killed Snoke because I thought he was turning good again, but it turns out he\\'s still evil and just wanted to be Supreme Leader so he wouldn\\'t have to take orders from anyone anymore. I guess it wouldn\\'t have made much sense if he turned good again because then who would\\'ve been the main Force-using villain? The ensuing battle between Rey and Kylo vs. Snoke\\'s guards was pretty cool, I just wish there would\\'ve been an actual lightsaber vs. lightsaber duel because this is actually the first Star Wars movie (aside from Rogue One) without one, which makes me kinda sad. Probably the biggest question going into \\'The Last Jedi\\' was the mystery of Rey\\'s parentage. It turns out her parents were just... nobodies. Drunks who sold young Rey off for drinking money or a way off Jakku or something, which was initially very disappointing to me because I really wanted her to be descended from or related to a character from the original trilogy or even the prequels. But the more I think about Rey essentially coming from nothing, the more I\\'m ok with it. After all, Anakin Skywalker was just a slave boy (and so was his mother), and I guess it shows fans that anyone can be a hero, no matter who you are or where you come from. Plus, it means she\\'s free to forge her own path and make her own destiny instead of being held down by a famous bloodline. I really hope she has a double-bladed lightsaber like Darth Maul\\'s in Episode 9, since she\\'s proficient with a staff. The scene at the end with the little boy on Canto Bight using the Force to grab the broom and holding it like a lightsaber while wearing Rose\\'s Resistance ring was cool because I think it symbolizes that a new generation of Jedi will rise, so the Jedi will never really \"end\" as Luke wanted. The acting from everyone was fantastic, and I think this was definitely Mark Hamill\\'s finest performance as an older and more weary Luke. Overall, while there are some parts I didn\\'t like, the film as a whole was solid. Not my favorite Star Wars film (that honor goes to The Force Awakens), but definitely solid, I just really wish Luke went out like more of the epic badass I know he is.

       " \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017, Rian Johnson)Well this film is a very mixed bag and somewhat a disappointment. After JJ Abrams brought back the magic with a somewhat overly familiar kick off to the new trilogy I had been looking forward to seeing it go in new directions for the next episode. However whilst it did go in some new directions (as well as mirroring previous chapters), I did not like where it went or think it was executed very well.I am not really a fan of the director and this did nothing to change it. The visuals bar the space battles were not memorable, the design of creatures was often poor and going backwards with an over reliance of cgi is such a shame after how good The Force Awakens looked. The humour in the Force Awakens was much mover over the top than we had ever seen before in Star Wars but it still worked but in The Last Jedi it kicks off with Marvel Cinematic Universe style humour that doesn't fit and continued to sprinkle that in throughout. The magic was missing and the beats just felt all wrong for large sections of the film. I did not care for the script but it was the directorial execution that was more uninspired and I am happy that JJ will be back in the directors chair for the last part.There were things I did like though... as in most all of the scenes on the Island with Luke Skywalker and Rey. As mentioned before the space battles looked very slick, especially the opening one. A couple of new characters shone like Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and DJ (Benicio Del Toro) but some disappointing characters from The Force Awakens were still quite bad like Snoke (Andy Serkis), Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) and Admiral Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). One thing that was a pleasant surprise was the little furry creatures known as Porgs that have caused much debate were actually pretty good and used sparingly.In the end it was a very messy unfocused film that did not wow outside of the space battles with a mixed bag of performances and too much silly humour which should not be confused for charm. A huge disappointment but some seeds are set that could easily be steered into a rousing final chapter in two years time.\",\n",
       " \"Don't waste your money, this isn't Star Wars. This movie (and the previous one) just ruined everything the franchise established to this day.

New age trash filled with ideological and political propaganda, visions and concepts.\",\n",
       " 'After scrolling through the comments for a few minute, there is no way that this film got 7+ stars... NO WAY! The average rating I saw was probably 2/10... Who paid you off IMDb? Disney? The Star Wars franchise? Rian Johnson?',\n",
       " 'I made an account just to review this.The Force Awakens was meh, but I understood what its purpose was: to rekindle excitement for Star Wars after over a decade of decline with the prequels and Star Trek starting to garner hype.Rogue One was brilliantly done, original, and had perhaps the best space battle scene I\\'ve ever seen. It gave me hope for The Last Jedi (\"TLJ\").I saw TLJ twice in theaters when it came out. Usually I reserve this honor for really good films or dense films in which I hope to pick up additional tid bits that I missed the first time around. For TLJ, it was because I was so shocked and disappointed with the first viewing it was surreal; I had to confirm my disappointment. I also rented it today to give it a third try. I won\\'t be buying it.Disney has done severe damage to the Star Wars franchise with this one movie. You can see it in the wide chasm between critic review ratings and non-elite, non-Hollywood review ratings. Everyone I talk to on the ground hates TLJ, with its contrived non-Star Wars humor, its strong injection of third wave feminism/SJW viewpoints, its lack of originality, and its disjointed/jarring storyline.The story opens with a \"spoof\" on Hux by Poe Dameron. The first time I saw this in theaters (opening night), not a lot of people were laughing. It was cringe worthy and felt so out of place that it seemed like an SNL skit of a Star Wars scene. The original trilogy was humorous but without being contrived or turning characters into clowns. A lot of scenes with Han Solo attest to this. Stop trying to force comedic scenes or comedic moments. That\\'s not why Star Wars fans come to watch Star Wars!It feels like the writers for TLJ genuinely haven\\'t seen a Star Wars movie before.Star Wars fans also don\\'t come to see Star Wars to have one sided political reflections of our current society thrown at them. I\\'m not going to go into it in detail, but why are the demographics of the First Order (the bad guys) so different than that of the \"Rebellion\" (the good guys)? Also Canto Bight was cool but spare us the hackneyed lecture from Rose about rich evil people and poor oppressed people that was shoved unnecessarily into the script.They should have let Leia expire on the blown into space scene. It would have been the easy out. Instead we get a completely unprecedented scene in which she not only survives space but either pulls herself back to the spaceship or the spaceship to her. Come on man... Powerful Sith and Jedi have been marked out with far less than that.Also with Leia, on Crait, what the hell is with the anime scene of her posing right off the bat? It was extremely vain, like, look how pretty she is audience. The rebels are being chased, hunted, and killed by the first order and she has time to change, redo her makeup, and do a Vogue magazine pose by the front door? Give me a break... Is this Star Wars?There\\'s so much more I didn\\'t like, but that\\'s all been touched on ad nauseum by other reviewers. The neutering and shoving aside of Luke Skywalker, a brand new Star Wars universe where everything is made up on the spot and doesn\\'t matter, the recycling of original trilogy scenes/themes in TLJ, Mary Sue Rey who literally has no training but can take on Ben Solo who has what appears to be at a least a decade of combined Jedi/Sith training and she lifts dozens of boulders for the end of the movie escape effortlessly when even Yoda struggled and had to concentrate to move heavy objects (Luke\\'s X-Wing, platforms in the fight against Palpatine), etc.Did Disney have any plan when they started this new trilogy? Let\\'s have different directors and writers for each one! There needs to be consistency! You can branch out beyond the original trilogy themes while remaining true to the Star Wars universe. There\\'s a whole expanded universe of books out there! You seem to be doing the opposite, recycling the original Star Wars themes while destroying the Star Wars universe and fan base. You\\'re hollowing Star Wars out with movies like this.I didn\\'t think I\\'d ever say this....but this film is worse than any one of the prequels. It\\'s the worst \"episode\" Star Wars film made yet. If I do end up accidentally purchasing, it will be because it comes along (unfortunately) in a box set.',\n",

Why is he fishing for giant rubber fish with a 50 foot long stick?The section on the Casino planet is worse than anything George Lucas dreamed up in the prequels, it's just bad. As is the new love interest of Finn, about as simple a backstory as you can get, the worst first kiss ever commited to film and it urinates all over any connection from the Force Awakens between Finn and Rey, not that there was much of one but a lingering shot in The Last Jedi seems to imply that Rey is in love with Finn now. I don't know. This film does what it likes.Leia is a Jedi and can fly in space without a ship in what must be one of the most WTF moments in any film with lore, Snoke is completely CG for no reason and looks like a character render from a PS3 cutscene, the AT-ATs have emotions now and can square up to people. It's just bizarre.Redeeming things about this film are few. Mark Hamill was decent, I enjoyed his performance for the most part, there are a couple of set pieces that are visually great.

It's an epic and original Star Wars movie, with gorgeous cinematography and incredible music from the wonderful John Williams again. Rain Johnson has managed to expand the force mythology, inject some good ol' humour back into the saga, and throw in some wonderful surprises, that I believe, we all needed. It seems like many of you do not like change, or are not prepared to enjoy a Star Wars movie that takes risks. This movie takes huge risks; it dares to offer something fresh in a franchise that is over 40 years old. It also pays homage to the original trilogy in a beautiful and tasteful way. So, no, I do NOT understand the haters out there. Nevertheless, it's not a perfect movie. There are some risks that Johnson takes, that will upset some fans, but some of those decisions have made me ponder the force in a new way. One of the main problems for me was the 'detour' from the main storyline with Finn and Rose. This storyline felt a bit sluggish, 'forced' and feels kind of shoehorned in there, and it also doesn't really serve the greater story-but then again, maybe it DOES. I will need to see it again to decide on this. There were also a handful of 'dumb' little moments, that I won't get into, and certainly at times I was reminded that Star Wars movies were originally made for children, and while we have our darker adult themes at work here (and even spiritual themes), there are also many magical moments for children. Maybe us 'grownups' need to stop taking it all so seriously and learn to be kids again? For the most part, this is a solid, original and gorgeous Star Wars movie that I believe, makes The Force Awakens seem a little bland and unoriginal.

This failed attempt at comedy was but one of many examples of the complete lack of basic intellect throughout this film.2-The bombers all fly close together. One is hit - they all blow up. Was this their first time? So what if other planes have had that formation - that's a dopey excuse for a complete moron to make, not an experienced pilot. If you're craft is that explosive, you use a different plan, a different formation, it's that simple. But for the sake of drama they chose the path completely lacking intellect.3- So we know Rose wasn't written to be an intelligent character for many reasons. I'll mention two of the many. What person escaping with everyone looking for them leaves the manhole cover off? I realize she wasn't intended to be a complete moron, but the lack of the writer's intellect was passed on to this unfortunate character. The writer didn't go with tracking sensors in the pipes or anything...smart...instead resorting to stupidity.4- Rose saving Finn. Nice gesture. Sentimental. Practical or intelligent? Not even slightly. First, everyone is about to be killed and the traitor stops the one person ready to save them. Second, do you save your friend by smashing your car into them at high speed? The only reason Finn is alive and Rose isn't dead already is the writer. It was dopey and insulting to the sacrifice and intellect of the audience.5-leadership - yes, the leadership was so awful they invited mutiny. Drama, keeping secrets, especially in time of need is one thing, but at least say they suspect a traitor or something. Do something smart instead of being dumb so everyone turns on each other.6-Yeah, that's not how explosions work. When you are in a room that blows up, you're filled with glass, metal, fire and more. You don't just blow up, wake up a few seconds later unscathed and float to safety. It was incredibly silly and deserved to be mocked for many reasons. Unless the point was that explosions miss bigger than Stormtroopers.There are smart ways of handling things, but Rian went dumb every time. Even in dealing with fan theories, he thought it would be a good idea to toss out all the good ideas and turn everything into nothing. No specialness to Rey or Snoke. Have look turn his back on everything for drama.And in dealing with fan concerns and complaints you don't just insult them further. There was nothing satisfying for the fans when everything is taken away, everything falls flat, everything is nothing and then the fool insulted them for pointing out valid problems.Keep Rian away! He's not smart enough for Star Wars and has zero respect for fans and their theories.\",\n",

The second movie in the trilogy needs to build upon what has gone before, or it renders both pointless. It is easy to subvert expectations but not so easy to subvert them in a satisfying manner. The cast do their best with what they have but the script is terrible, badly paced and has plot holes that you can fly a star destroyer through. The decades of Star Wars history are ignored in favour of lame jokes and muddled mysticism. It appears the Rian Johnson Effect has done for Solo but this is the movie to blame',\n",

He failed at doing either well, somehow pandering and veering from the path that had been set for years.Yes, had he tried to redo Empire or Return of the Jedi, it would have been to obvious but man, changing things just to tell the loyalist \\'ha, fooled you, the plot lines you thought you knew I\\'ve made into parody\" seem more cruel than original. Twists are exciting when built up or around a central, undefinable theme, but to dislodge from the linneae course of characters, subplots and themes because he thought it would be funny (many examples of this throughout the movie) wasn\\'t innovative or creative, just misplaced and awkward.I was excited to share this new Star Wars saga with my kids, and now, it\\'s lost it\\'s luster. Hopefully, Hollywood will see the great potential the storyline could\\'ve had and redo this soon and try to stop the titanic from sinking, although, at this point, Disney is focused on $ and nothing else, so no one would have the strength to say, \"nope, that\\'s not what anyone wants, let\\'s fix this.\" Maybe George Lucas could come in and buy the franchise back, or at least the original plot and give it to someone else that doesn\\'t want to spat in the face of the fans that have been following the franchise for a while, but further their love for it by making it whole again.Wishful thinking, I know.

       " 'First, going back a second... I loved the newest characters from SW 7 (Rey and Finn), but was disappointed in the movie. SW 7 had a good story, but that was because it was the same one George Lucas gave us in SW 4, and that was the problem, it was the SAME story. After waiting almost 40 years, in the end, we just got the original movie, with new characters plugged in for the originals.The problem with this latest film is that not only did it not really advance the story in any significant way, but it continuously uses ridiculously unbelievable plot contrivances. Even in SW 7, the First Order has clearly inherited the vast resources of the Empire (its warships, etc.), but suddenly, in this film, we get multiple, stretched out (supposedly, \"nail biting\") battle sequences that should have ended in \"seconds\" (won by the First Order), but seem to be replicas of 20th century, World War II battles, as though the First Order (since SW 7) no longer seems to have anything better than a few \"tugboats\", with \"muzzle-loaded cannons\". Despite \"ruling the galaxy\", we are supposed to accept that the First Order can no longer manage to wage even a basic space battle. Maybe a seven year-old might find these sequences \"exciting\", but for anyone else, they are really just laughably awful.Maybe that\\'s my problem. Maybe the target audience, now, is just young children, but for those of us who (as adults) thoroughly enjoyed the original trilogy, it is sad to see the core of this franchise evolve into something so awful.If you want to see a Star Wars worthy film, just purchase Rogue One, and watch that several times a year. That\\'s the \"bar\" that the rest of the franchise should have been reaching for. It is orders of magnitude better than SW 7 or 8, and for that matter, SW 1-3 as well. It also is clear evidence that \"someone in the world\" actually knows how to write a great SW script. Sadly those folks aren\\'t writing scripts for this latest trilogy.',\n",

Jokes were made, that made the film feel more like a knock off of Space Balls, rather than a Star Wars film. Luke is dead, both figuratively and literally. His character was butchered and became someone whom I could not support. The film is also filled with a lot of sexism and racism, disguised as social justice propaganda. This movie also takes the new characters that were introduced in TFA, and makes them all completely unrelatable and unlikable. The ending left me angry, confused, and utterly heart broken. There is no point in seeing episode 9, for all the Skywalkers are dead in the \"Skywalker Saga\", the new characters aren\\'t worth watching, or rooting for in anyway. Best case scenario for episode 9, is that everyone dies in the first 10 minutes. I wouldn\\'t recommend this movie for anyone. May god have mercy on Ruin Johnson\\'s Black soul',\n",

       " 'Everyone told meNot to stroll on that beachSaid Disney gonna comePoke me in the coconutAnd he didAnd he didFirst of all, I didn\\'t like The Force Awakens. It felt extremely forced and most of the time it was just a lame rip-off of the old episodes. So, I totally didn\\'t plan to support The Last Jedi by paying for it. And then that awesome trailer happened... It was so... charming and mysterious that I thought \"Whatever!\". And went to premiere. Man, I was a fool...The best thing about The Last Jedi is that, unlike previous episode, it doesn\\'t really feel like exactly the same thing. There\\'s no another Death Star (well, no proper one that is), there\\'s no more \"father / kid\" stuff, etc. Thanks to that it feels somewhat fresh. Like it\\'s a movie on its own, not just copy / pasted content from the old movies. It is something new to see. Something you didn\\'t see before. I really liked that about the movie. Of course, some things are still feels old. For example. they literally turned Phasma into a new Boba Fett and it\\'s hard not to notice that. But all in all, this movie does provide new content. And it\\'s a good thing. Most of the things that were supposed to be pretty obvious and straightforward ended up in a totally unexpected way. Since the previous episode was extremely predictable, it was nice to see something different. The movie also comes with some nice new design and creations (porgs, for example, were really nice addition) and I loved that they still kept puppets as a part of the thing. All that is pretty good. Also, the final battle here is arguably the most beautiful one in the entire franchise. All that red and white colors... It looks incredible in 3D. The movie probably worth watching once just because of that beautiful final battle. People who designed it did fantastic job.Unfortunately, everything else about the movie is just bad. Especially the script. It\\'s just a mess. It doesn\\'t even feel like a proper movie. More like a bunch of some random scenes. But what really killed the movie is two things.1.Jokes. Yes, Star Wars always used to include some, but this... It doesn\\'t even feel like Star Wars anymore. Believe it, or not, it\\'s more like a MARVEL movie now. Remember Thor: Ragnarok? That\\'s how it is here. Cheap jokes even ruined Luke. I\\'m not kidding. Legendary Luke Skywalker in this movie looks more like an old internet troll. Since the early scenes the movie tries to be fun and fails. I thought Thor: Ragnarok killed the Thor series just because of such lame humor, but here it\\'s like a complete catastrophe for the entire franchise.2.Snoke. In the previous movie he was teased like a dark and mysterious being. For two years people tried to guess who he is. The first Sith, or some sort of vampire who lives by consuming the Force. But guess what? He\\'s nobody. Just some random guy. Not only he fails to be a proper villain. In this movie he looks like the most pathetic creature in the entire universe. He looks exactly like some random pimp from the gangster movie. You know, one of those \"all talks\" characters. Who dies right after everybody begins to think he\\'s too annoying.Snoke marks the point where everything goes down the drain for real. Just because thanks to him the whole trilogy falls apart like a house of cards. If he\\'s such a loser, why in the world everybody\\'s so afraid of him? How the First Order is even possible with such a \"supreme\" leader? Hows the whole war possible? I mean, in this movie we can see that it\\'s not that hard to get on Snoke\\'s ship. He isn\\'t hiding, or something. And with Luke so strong and Snoke so stupid... why in the world Luke didn\\'t even try to stop this war at the very beginning? To save a lot of lives. Just because he feels down? That\\'s just stupid. I mean, yeah, Star Wars movies aren\\'t supposed to be deep and realistic, but this is just... stupid.Think about it. Kylo Ren is just a kid. A kid who didn\\'t show any real power. He was beaten by a girl who took the lightsaber for the first time, he was almost killed by a Praetorian Guard, he was heavily humiliated by Luke, he didn\\'t do anything real for two movies besides whining... But he easily kills Snoke, who\\'s supposed to be big and important. With just a stupid pimp and a single wannabe Sith... How in the world the First Order can even be a thing?! It\\'s just... *sigh* Snoke\\'s death is literally the most stupid scene in the entire franchise. Probably the most stupid thing I\\'ve ever seen in any AAA movie. It\\'s THAT bad.Another thing I hated is that the movie doesn\\'t even try to think about the old movies. In The Phantom Menace Jedi Council refused to teach Anakin Skywalker because he was \"too old\" and therefore too unstable. And even though he got there eventually, he was heavily monitored all the time. In the original trilogy, Luke was trained as \"A New Hope\". He was way too old, but he was trailed by Grand Master Yoda himself. In this movie we have Rey. Who didn\\'t even know about the Force and just used the lightsaber for the first time. And everybody\\'s OK with her being the successor of the entire Jedi Order without any training whatsoever. It\\'s like nobody even cares anymore. The Force is strong with you? Go and do some stuff then. That\\'s how this movie works. It\\'s just mind-blowing how stupid it is.And that\\'s basically it. It looks pretty good, it\\'s nicely designed, there are good old actors we all love... But it\\'s so dull and stupid that it\\'s literally impossible to enjoy it. Any fan theory about this movie on Youtube is about 9999x times more interesting and complicated than this bunch of nonsense. If it\\'s true and Rian Johnson will also write the first episode for the new trilogy, then Force save us all... No idea why Disney just can\\'t hire a proper writer for such an expensive franchise, but I honestly do want them to stop with such lame approach. Even though I love Disney since I was a little kid and think that there\\'s a loot of good things about them, Star Wars is franchise that was killed exactly because of them. Stop, Disney. Just stop.

Please.Any economist can tell you, scarcity creates value. When there were only three Star Wars movies, they were treasures. The rest of the galaxy played out in your mind, in the Star Wars role playing game, and the EU books. It was great.Now that there are nine movies and counting, to say nothing of TV shows, they will become far less valuable, even if they were all just as good as the first three. Each time a new director fills in or replaces more of what you imagined of the Star Wars universe, it gets less special.That effect is greatly multiplied when four of the last six movies are pretty bad.That effect is also greatly multiplied when the WORST one, THIS movie, is supposed to be building to the climax of the recent trilogy.This movie mocks Star Wars universe and is an insult to fans.

First of all, Jar Jar, the ever annoying horrible Jar Jar from previous movies at least had a purpose as a (very poor) comic relief character. The fluffy penguins in Last Jedi on the other hand are 100% transparently there for no reason but toy sales. The action trumps everything in the movie. I have nothing against good action but come on.

All of the characters are so black and white, its mind numbing.A good movie is a good movie, be it a simple comedic Thor Ragnarok or a thought provoking Matrix.

It was a fantastic adventure filled with unexpected turns and imaginative storytelling.Say what you want about the Ewoks, but everything still remained in the greatest single story ever created that made it what it was. It was emotional, and inspiring. Star Wars created a new avenue for science fiction and human masterpiece cinema. It wasn\\'t perfect, but it was true to itself and we were all FULLY invested. Of course I\\'m talking about us Star Wars fans. WE actually own Star Wars. It\\'s a shared love that is timeless and bridges generations so when Disney acquired Lucasfilm and made promises to not ruin the magic we were hopeful. All hope is now lost, and the spark is completely gone.The Star Wars fan must be SAVED from paying to see this movie!We start of with a galactic space battle between {really} only two space cruisers. The dreadnaught is bad and the resistance ship is good. This battle actually continues for almost the entire damn movie. Right! Can you believe it?! All the while a couple of our heroes travel happily to and fro the space cruiser at will to get special quest items in order to escape. Really that\\'s all that happens here. Oh yeah, and resistance fighters are being killed every so once in awhile, but we really don\\'t care about any of them until it\\'s convenient to show them when numbers count. Of course they just totally disappear when they\\'re not needed anymore.Now this god-awful dumbed down trend of epic CGI chases that are so overblown and outside of moving the plot has finally reached its most ridiculous peak. There is a space horse chase through a casino, and believe it! Everything that can be rendered artificially on a computer screen is smashed. Our heroes are of course champion expert riders with no plot realistic element of danger through a montage of child-like gag reels. GAG REELS! Stop it! Everyone hates them. They\\'re so pathetically, and desperately forced upon you, it\\'s insulting. Extremely insulting. We hated them in Phantom Menace, we HATED them in Attack of the Clones, WE HATED them in Force Awakens! They just keep getting worse and more unintelligent. Remember how Star Wars became what it was? Intelligent story telling beyond anything we\\'ve ever known before.Characters are fleshed out in such a way that your booger eating children will recognize their costumes in the toy store. Poe, Kylo, Luke, and a couple of others are passable as characters in dialogue and acting, that\\'s about it. The Snoke battle was great, unfortunately completely wasted, and the climactic super awesome light speed sacrifice attack on the ultimate evil space cruiser begat more WTF moments than a sense of catering to what could make the movie at best forgivable.

In The Last Jedi, they explain her unnatural strength in the force for someone who has had zero training due to the fact that Snoke \"Force-connected\" her and Kylo Ren so that she has all of his abilities... come on. So DUMB. This movie is everything that Star Wars isn\\'t. I hate you, Rian Johnson, and I hate you Disney.',\n",

       " 'How to ruin Star Wars? Sell the rights to Disney!This movie is yet another massive disappointment following Force Awakens, which as much as I disliked it was a tad better than The Last Jedi. There is nothing left here of the Star Wars universe except for the non-Jedi\\'s repeating the \"May the force be with you\", which they say with such conviction you can tell its just some lame tagline they implemented so the viewer wouldn\\'t forget they were actually watching a Star Wars movie.In \\'Force Awakens\\' I actually enjoyed the prospect of there being yet another massively powerful Sith overlord, Snoke being introduced to the story as some massively shadowy figure, turns it out its just a malformed humanoid with force power who despite his incredible \"power\" missed the all-too important detail of a lightsaber being moved by the force right next to him, as if he had suddenly lost his force power or become blind to it, both being just as improbable and ludicrous to any actual Star Wars fan.The whole thing about wanting the very concept of \"Jedi\" to die out seems a tad shortsighted as that won\\'t take away the force which is supposedly a universal force (like \"gravity\") and the universe will still yield force sensitives over time, leaving them without guidance and knowledge seems like a sure way to have them seek guidance with those that still stand, the Sith. Yoda finally learning to talk is beyond everything, why stick with continuity when you can screw everything around by changing its most memorable and enjoyable feature? Its like if Arnold Schwarzenegger suddenly started speaking with a perfect high class British accent for no apparent reason. This shows just how little concern Disney has for the Star Wars \"world\" and how ready they are to reshape it to their liking, using the fact that they can stick \"Star Wars\" on it to guarantee sales. They just don\\'t care about the actual, pre-established Star Wars universe.I don\\'t get their constant need to keep going back to Maz as if she was the universe Wikipedia. Got a question? \"Maz\" it! (you know, instead of \"Google it!\"), for reasons unknown, she\\'ll have all the answers. It just comes off as way too easy a solution to people\\'s quandaries.Furthermore I really don\\'t like how Disney has even redefined the whole Jedi movement and what they were able to do, it seems like a completely new thing now than the normal \"Jedi\"-ism we\\'re used to, now it involves levitating and meditating leading to out-of-body projections, of course, why didn\\'t we see that coming?! Luke\\'s sacrifice seemed unnecessary at best, it just seemed to mirror Obiwan Kenobi\\'s sacrifice from Episode IV. And it was quite unluckily planned as Carrie Fisher passed away, both twins will be missing in the next movie, unless of course they decide to go the CGI way again to resurrect past actors (which I hope they won\\'t do as the renditions from Rogue One were extremely creepy and very unsettling to watch, couldn\\'t they find any actor on a planet of 7 billion people that could do the parts? did they even look?)I could go on dissecting this rather large heap of dung which is \\'The Last Jedi\\' but the Disney Star Wars have already sapped enough of my time, time I\\'ll never get back!

The action was actually intense and it didn\\'t have any acrobats + ballad sword fighting. The Force Awaken was ironically like a new hope to revitalize the franchise after the disappointing Prequels. But watching this drawn out sloppy multi-story comedy that happens to have lasers in it, is comparable to what Anakin Skywalker must have felt when he was being burnt alive by lava with dismembered limbs. The writers and directors feel like they have taken Star Wars in a whole new direction. When really it\\'s basically The Empire Strikes Back with prettier graphics. While the actual original ideas of the writers is shown with Luke drinking discolored milk from an alien tit.The plot was somewhat promising. The thought of the Rebel Alliance low on soldiers and low on fuel while also being tracked by an entire fleet of the Empire seems like it could be thrilling. It almost makes us feel like their are high stakes in this movie, like we and the characters are in for a loss this time. But they completely rid all the tension away with ridiculously story arcs within the movie. When it really should have been between two stories. Rey being trained by Luke and the Rebel Alliance struggling to get from point A to point B without dying. But we are subjected to moronic planning and unnecessary plot twists that do nothing for the story. To make matters worst. The Luke Skywalker character is completely destroyed, like the creators have not even gave any thought to what his character stood for. What he endured from the planet of Tatooine as a simple farm boy to the lightsaber wielding Jedi Knight celebrating on Endor for the defeat of the Empire and the Sith. All of that is forgotten to simply accommodate the forced direction of the writers and director. The ending is confusing too. I don\\'t know if we\\'re supposed to be feeling happy or devastated. Something tells me we\\'re supposed to feel like we\\'ve lost with the characters in the story. But even the writers forget that the Rebel Alliance has lost 90% of It\\'s army. Generals, Fleets, Countless soldiers have died as well as Luke Skywalker. But at the end everyone is cheery and giving each other high fives like they just won the super bowl. Even our main hero Rey doesn\\'t seem to care that she has let down many people. She was supposed to go be trained by the last Jedi Master. Come back and kick the empires ass. Instead she comes back and only savds enough Rebels to fill the millennium falcon. While also failing to convert Kylo Ren to good. That was a pretty big part of the plot.

I didn\\'t care too much for Episode 2 mainly because of how boring Anakin and Padme was.So what went wrong with this movie? Let\\'s break this down:DUMB MOMENTSStar Wars movies had its fair share of dumb moments. Episode 1 had about anything with Jar Jar (though his character never bothered me other than he was too Roger Rabbit). Episode 2 had the speech about sand, the scene where C3PO fell off and tossed around and then swapped with a droid army dude. Episode 3 had that awkward scene with Anakin and Padme about how beautiful she is, A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back really doesn\\'t have any but Return of the Jedi had the Ewoks beating on the Empire. Point is, there\\'s usually a dumb moment in these films. So why are people harping more on this film? I think because the previews showed this to be a serious film and left out all the stupid parts. They aren\\'t the main reason why I don\\'t like this film but every single time I reflect back I can\\'t help but think Leia Poppins (the dumbest scene in the movie) or Luke drinking that milk. I can go on about these dumb scenes but for a company trying so hard to be better than the prequels, it\\'s baffling why these are in the film at all.LUKE SKYWALKERThe main reason I was excited about this film was Luke Skywalker. Now the company changed hands, and me and everyone else hold this character so dear, we want him to be handled appropriately. However, I can\\'t help but think that Disney\\'s slogan is, \"Out with the old, in with the new\" as they want to kick the old characters to the curb and make way for the new characters for everyone. Now I can\\'t but think this might be a way for them to make money off of their own toys. Whatever the case may be, they didn\\'t handle Luke well.I don\\'t mind Luke being a grumpy old hermit. I think that idea is pretty cool. The problem is that the writing of it sucks. Why is he a hermit? Because he tried to kill his nephew, Kylo Ben, and he doesn\\'t want to have to face him because he would upset Han and Leia by having to face him. If you really think about that, it doesn\\'t make any sense. Luke said he saw the darkness in him and he almost killed him. Well, he was right. Snoke took control of him and now his nephew and going around killing everybody. He\\'s a demon seed, Luke. Kill him.Then he gets the most upsetting death scene since Captain Kirk. So get this: Kylo is about to blow the main heroes up in this mine so Luke comes in as a force projection to face him and this kills Luke in the process. So much potential for an awesome finish just wasted. Wouldn\\'t it be cool if Luke took down all those walkers with his powers? But no, that can\\'t happen because we have another movie to make and Rey has to finish him off.THE STORYThis right here is the main reason this film sucks. Not only does it suck but it already reflects the whole series. Everything that was set up by Force Awakens doesn\\'t even matter because the director flushed it down the toilet. When you have different directors and writers for each one, each ego bigger than the other, they tend to throw things out and change things to suit their needs. Rian Johnson didn\\'t know where to go with Snoke and apparently nobody else did either and he kills him. Wait, let me talk about Snoke for a second here....SNOKEThere was a lot of mystery surrounding this character and I was enjoying the theories. Fans have speculated about this character and of course, it turns out this character is nothing but a generic villain. He came off that way in the last film. He was basically a hologram generic Voldemort. In this film, he had potential. For once, Rey was getting bested by someone for once. FINALLY! Someone who is actually a threat but nope, he dies. Then that wimp Kylo takes his place. Yawn.BACK TO THE STORYSorry about that. So what is the story? A big evil ship is chasing down a little ship running out of gas. Meanwhile, the all-knowing, already all powerful Rey seeks the help of Luke Skywalker. He offers training in which he never gives her so she just learns on her own. There is also a pointless subplot about finding a codebreaker that serves no real purpose to the story other than using the sets that was already established for the film. THE ENDINGWhen the film ended, I asked myself, \"What did I just watch?\" When those closing credits appeared on film, I honestly didn\\'t know what we are looking forward to in the next installment. This kid with a broom? Watch Rey beat Kylo Ren for a third time? I don\\'t understand his character either. Why is it that he could stopped lasers in mid-air and was actually a scary presence until he took the mask off. Then he was a joke just like his very own crew. Hux was just a comic relief and honestly the heroes should have beaten them in the last movie. I feel like there is nothing to look forward to in the last installment of this new trilogy. They better resurrect Vader, Darth Maul, Boba Fett or whoever if they want people to return to this disaster of a trilogy. Unfortunately, I might as well finish this trilogy off anyway.

       " 'Dumbest version of the series to date. Hollywood is a one-trick pony. Hollywood feels the need to make 18 year old yuppies heroes beyond their years. You see the same one-trick-pony in Maze Runner, Divergent, Hunger Games, etc. Basically, 18 year olds with next to zero life experience saving worlds and defeating entire well trained well supplied armies.In the original Star Wars films, the yuppie (Luke Skywalker) had mentors e.g. Yoda (wisest of the wise), Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, etc. People with experience basically protected and mentored the newbie throughout the film. The villain in those days was also a serious person with years of experience making the story more dramatic and believable.Today, according to Hollywood\\'s one-trick-pony, teenage yuppies are basically on their own and must trial-and-error their way into saving the planet or the galaxy. Those \"old\" people (26 an older) are mostly in the way with their so-called experience. Even the villain is a bullied looking, spoiled 18 year old yuppie throwing temper tantrums as though his parents just punished him by telling him to clean up his room. I did not know a person could act so poorly in such a major film. He must be related to someone high up in the business.Add to it more horrible casting, the horrible writing, and horrible plot. Not to mention this is a lame, feminists movement film that happens to contain Star Wars. From the feminist bomber, to the feminist commander, to the feminist Guard, to the feminist Jedi. This movie is born of the man-hating, neutered society we live in today. The males are portrayed as either pure evil, or bumbling idiots, unsure of themselves and constantly screwing up. Meanwhile, Leia is so powerful, she gets blown into space, survives 450 degrees below zero. (Look it up), zero pressure (vacuum), and zero air to breath. She then wields the force and flies through space back to the damaged ship. What an utterly stupid scene. That had to be the worst scene in the entire franchise of Star Wars films ever made. Even Yoda never pulled a stunt like that. Oh, he was male. I understand.The Last Jedi\\'s only charm is the comedy, which says a lot as to how far Star Wars has fallen. The ridiculous villain looks like a spoiled kid who is still being bullied by the captain of the football team. The Last Jedi is more poorly written, cast, and directed than Girls Gone Wild.The entire plot consists of the teen hero (Rey) with zero life experience walking around behind a neutered Luke Skywalker. as the fleet is running away in a slow speed chase through 95% of this awful movie. The BS astral projection discussions between Rey and the bullied (looking) extremely childish villain was the worst made-up garbage I have ever seen.Yoda comes back from the dead to strike a tree with lightning (what was the purpose of that scene?). Skywalker mystically fades away after astral projecting himself to fight the horribly cast, no acting, bullied (looking) villain.The reformed storm trooper (Finn) raised for battle from a child, is unsure of himself and every thing he does. Somehow he meets a young Asian lady (another 18 year old) and appears to trade Rey in for her as a love interest. Hollywood in its infinite racism hates the thought of a black man being with a strong white woman. Yet they love casting white men dominating strong black women. I simply wish they would be even handed with their portrayal of cross-cultural relationships.Anyone who gives this garbage high marks is easily entertained and are likely a sucker for a shiny twirling object dangled in front of their nose. The only version almost as bad as this is the one with young Darth Vader played by that non-acting, wooden actor who played Anakin Skywalker in an earlier episode.',\n",

I cannot understand how anyone enjoyed this movie. At least we got to know who Supreme Leader Snook was. A nobody and it doesn\\'t matter anyway. There is no background story.

       " \"I'm not even a die hard Star Wars fan, but as many others have already pointed out - this film is badly flawed in many, many ways. I'll just mention the beginning of the film:You got the bad guys fleet of ships within range of the rebels' fleet which is trying to evacuate, and the bad guys do nothing. They've got a fudging massive dreadnought ship, and they do nothing.Instead, a tiny insignificant craft goes over to the bad guys (while they still do nothing) and makes a prank phone call, to buy time for the rebel fleet and so that he can get closer to the point where they can't use their big guns on him.At this point I knew that this wasn't going to be a good story - there are some nice visuals etc, but no plot, much like a porno. Except the only people pleasuring themselves as a result of this film are the director and producers.This great, evil, merciless enemy still does nothing while the little hot shot takes out their cannons - no scrambling of their tie fighters, no firing on the rebel fleet, no raising their shields. Instead they shoot the empty base, just as the last rebel ship leaves in the nick of time. All the while some bombers have been sneakily coming straight at them. Only now do the baddies spring into action - you can sense that the one commander is frustrated by the inaction of the pale guy in charge, who seems to be stupefied by the prank call - how the hell did he get to where he is? Why doesn't Snoke kill him? Oh, there's some kind of tracker involved, so it was all part of an elaborate plan that cost them their dreadnought and more just so that they could chase the rebels for the rest of the film. WTF?The same crap happens at the end - the bad guys rock up with superior fire power and have the opportunity to wipe out the rebels, but are stumped when a single dude walks out to meet them, taunts them, allowing the rebels to escape with the help of the salt foxes that for some reason have hidden in the base with them - these indigenous creatures' only purpose in life is to help the rebels find a way out which has been there all along since before the base's construction, but no one knew about it because of some fallen rocks.OK, I went on a bit longer than expected, but you get the picture.

Aside from there being so much moments and scenes that just didn't make sense when it comes to star wars the movie also dosen't focus on the main cast and story well enough and as it should but goes out of its way to make it blatantly obvious how politically correct it is. Now its so much more politically correct then TFA that it's cringeworthy at times and scenes will feel more like watching a commercial then a movie.

       " \"First off everyone is wondering how this movie tile got 7.7 out of 10 stars now down to 7.4 stars which is still way to many stars for this title and how all the critics seem to say this is one of the best star wars created yet. Well it all comes down to money Disney paid 2 billion dollars to get this franchise there is no way they are going to lose money on this or break even that is not a profitable business. Also Disney needs to keep making money on this title after it gets old an by it having a very low rating or getting negative reviews by all the critics a new comer to the franchise might be discourage and not want to waste the time to watch it or buy it. This is disappointing me that IMDB a trusted site of mine would sell out a long with the critics but sometimes that is what you got to do to stay in the business. Now the problem is that star wars was a great fantasy world with a very interesting story and something new in each episode created (even star wars episodes 1-3 in my opinion deserve 8 stars as well). This series has flopped because Disney is as stated above in the business to make money an they do that very well but normally the mvoies they make are cartoon movies geared at the younger generation with the intent to sell toys or family orientated like Mary Popins that parents can take their kids to. This is why Disney making the new star wars was a bad idea star wars was not made to sell a bunch of junk to little kids or band wagon fanboys it was a movie for adults who liked the fantasy world and others getting into the fantasy world. Even though Disney has trashed star wars they are genius for making JJ. Abrams who is one of the worst writers and directors of our time to headline this movie because that is exactly what he does sells junk to people who do not understand good movies. An if you don't think JJ. Abrams had a hand in The Last Jedi you would be wrong this movie stinks of him watch some of his other movies if you can sit through them and than re watch this movie again if you can sit through it. Although JJ. Abrams was not mentioned in this title I bet he was pulling most of the strings, but if you want to put all the blame on Rian Johnson that is up to you. Also if you look at Rian Johnson's other works most of those titles are actually good so why wouldn't he try an take another chance at making another great film. Lastly if you watch the side movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story that is a much better movie than the main one because it has no affiliation with JJ. Abrams (still not as good as star wars episodes 1-6 but a mediocre movie if you want something to watch).Now onto the movie its self it has been about a year since I have seen this movie but i couldn't hold back and had to write something so some of what i write might not be everything but ill try to keep it close now can i say that hasn't already been said. The opening scene with the prank phone call by Poe Dameron to buy time for the fleet to get into position to take out the juggernaut was one of the dumbest things i have seen in a while. Only a child would laugh at something like this but like I said previously this is something JJ. Abrams would do an if i missed it and star wars is now a fantasy comedy i can honestly say any jar jar binks scene was better than this one. Now the action scene following this was ok but the fantasy world need a good story to go along with it or else its just a mindless movie with action clips in it. Next section i would like to touch on is Luke Skywalker teaching Rey who is already an accomplish warrior that has never meet a real jedi in her entire life but can defeat someone who has already been trained by a sith lord and has all the jedi powers of a master jedi with zero training. For instance when Luke has decided to help Rey with her training and they are on the cliff and he tells her to look deep into the force. Which Rey has not problem with she instantly is able to grow her powers without any struggle at all but while doing that she finds a dark and evil hole and now has to find it so she can see what its all about. when Rey finds the hole she gets sucked in and finds a mirror inside where hundreds of reflections of herself are looking back at her and you cant forget about the annoying finger snap that seems to echo throughout the entire mirror. This is supposed to be something that helps you with the story but i still cant seem to figure out what the point of it was. This is also a take away from the empire strikes back, but in the empire strikes back Luke fights a fake Darth vader chops his head off after he wins he sees himself in vaders mask which some people can say oh that's say if you get seduce by the dark side you will end up just like vader or you can say it has something to do with vader being Lukes son but that isnt revealed until return of the jedi either way it helped make a good plot hole in the story and made you think. The scene with Rey did none of the above and you were just happy when she got out of that hole. Onto the casino scene where Finn and Rose have to find the code breaker so the rebel fleet could escape the empire fleet that whole part of the movie yet again was very uncreative most of it was just CGI scenes and stuff to market for little kids. The main reason why i mention this part is the scene where Finn and Rose ride through the casino on fathier's wrecking everything in sight is a straight up JJ Abrams move that is something he loves to do in all his movies and yet again he had nothing to do with this movie. I could go on and on but dont feel like writing a book so ill cut the rest short. The progs on the millennium falcon just trying to sell junk, snokes death yet again stupid but they had to get rid of him because the writers are not creative enough to come up with something to make him a good part of the story, pincless Leia floating back from outer space one of the worst parts of the movie, captain phasma fight I forgot who this guy even was because the force awakens was just as bad as this movie, Yoda showing up out of nowhere to lecture Luke who really isnt part of the movie at all than shooting lightning bolt to burn a tree down, D'Qar battle scene another take away from the empire strikes back, Luke making a hologram of himself so the rebellion can escape than disappearing into thin air, and many more all this stuff is supposed to give plots holes and fills plot holes and make a good story so when you walk out you will want to come back to see the next movie but you did not get a feeling for anything of that I myself was filled with anger and disappointment.Conclusion this movie fails along with all the other star wars movies Disney will make because star wars was not a universe made to be a comedy so it could sell things to little kids and band wagon fanboys.So what can we do about this first off the public needs to stop watching any movie made by JJ. Abrams and only give bad reviews to the point that people stop hiring him to write and direct movies and we need to stop feeding the money to Disney until they can make an actual good star wars movie they spent 2 billion dollars to get this franchise make them work for it or else you will only get bad movies from here on.\",\n",

On one hand you're enjoying the spectacle, on the other you're tearing your hair out in despair.I'll keep this short.

The fact that it's a Star Wars film makes it every bit as tragic as Carrie Fisher's actual passing. I can't help but feel her death as the actress playing the matriarchal lead protagonist was some cosmic karma righting itself through the force for Rian and Kathy. Mostly Kathy because Rian had already finished with her by that point in time. It's how he operates I'd imagine. Suck up until you get what you want then discard people. Like a sociopathic little vampire.I don't need to give any explanation, as many have preceeded me, but JJ Abrams did not set a good precedent by killing off Han Solo so early on.

The film is a mess and poorly written. It's also way too long of what it should be clocking at 2hrs and 30 mins. The only characters I cared about was Luke and the rest of the old gang.

       " 'I\\'ve never been a Star Wars maniac, but I\\'ve enjoyed all of the movies for the most part leading up to this one. Here are the reasons this movie sucked out loud, and why there will probably be a worldwide outcry for the movie to be deleted from the record and be remade.No laws of physics: Again, I\\'m not a Star Wars scholar, I\\'ve only seen the movies, but even in a sci-fi world, there has to be SOME consistency with laws of physics so we can actually feel a sense of danger for the characters. Now all of a sudden, if you are a main character, you have no problem surviving in space without a mask. You can make a skype call anywhere in the universe if youre a main character. Your spaceship can be tracked through space and time at lightspeed, but for some reason cant be shot at from short range. And falling into an interdimensional artsy-fartsy cave for 15 minutes is a substitute for actual Jedi training.No danger: Rey needs to infiltrate the most high security evil ship in the universe. Does she have a clever plan--nope. No plan? No problem, because there is no danger/no consequenses to any action in this movie. Need to kill a powerful boss who can read your mind and connect skype calls across the universe? No problem, just count on him to not be reading your mind literally 2 seconds after he demonstrates he can read your mind. Want to survive your ship being blown in half and you being in space without a mask? Just fly over to the ship like Marry Poppins.No characters: Luke being an old depressed broken man undermines all the lessons taught throughout the original series about how wisdom and doing the right thing will lead to salvation. Rey\\'s character teaches the lesson that you don\\'t have to work toward your goals and put in effort to improve, just be born with the force and be kinda a nice person and boom you\\'re ready to fight the most powerful evil in the universe. The purple hair lady was nothing less than a completely useless mute who would rather let people die than explain herself. This again, teaches a horrible lesson--you need not possess any real leadership qualities to ascend to leadership. Snoke also was just boring, generic, and \"bad\". Vader was feared, admired, commanded respect, and had a purpose and a goal. Contrast Snoke with a truly evil, dynamic character such as Heath Ledger\\'s joker. And Emo Kylo Ren is an embarassment. Somehow even though he\\'s taking massive amounts of testosterone to get that buff, hes still a soy boy.No point: All of the previous points being combined--if you cant die outside of committing suicide, and you have the power to make skype calls and do artsy interdimensional shape shifting--why do a bunch of resistance characters need to bother being chased through space? Why doesn\\'t Ren realize that 5 more minutes on that skype call with Cuck-lo Ren and he would have dropped out of the First Order and taken her to a My Chemical Romance concert?Overall, this movie just sucked out loud. Maybe if you\\'re the modern-art type, or maybe are into heavy drugs you can enjoy the visuals of this movie, but anyone who actually likes plots, characters, stories, and earning power rather than waking up lucky, will want to use the Ace Ventura plunger on themselves after watching this pile of warm garbage. I bet this will be the first movie in history that is scrapped from the record books and completely remade.',\n",
       " 'Okay, to get the good things out of the way: great visuals, some interesting new ideas, decent acting and entertaining on the surface. However, after watching it a second time, the glaring plotholes and lazy writing in general just cannot be overseen.The worst of those instances is perhaps the way Luke Skywalker, the sympathetic, optimistic hero of the original trilogy, is dealt with. While I generally think it could have been interesting to give his character a dark side, the way it is done in this movie is just terrible. The same character who did not hesitate to risk his life because he believed in the good of Darth Vader, who not only cut of his arm and tortured his sister, but slaughtered billions, is now willing to kill is student and nephew in his sleep because of some vision? Far from being a clever \"subversion\" of his character, a well written subversion catching the audience by surprise at first, but appearing entirely logical in hindsight, it is just lazy writing, and takes any credibility from the plot.Similarily, the movie works hard to reinforce sexist stereotypes, Rey being essentially perfect in everything she does etc without much training (see Mary Sue), Admiral Holdo being blatantly incompetent (see How to communicate with subordinates) and Rose saving Finn \"for love\" when he was about to save the resistance from obliteration, something that is done instead by Rey in another incredibly convenient scene.Apart from that, plenty of other minor and major problems, even with stuff as basic as object permanence (weapons disappearing midfight, people \"teleporting\" over battlefield\".So yeah, not the best.',\n",

This feels like a movie made by someone who either never watched Star Wars before, or hated what they saw and wished to remake it in their own image.Not only a squandered opportunity. It also has this weird effect of changing my perception of the movies that precede it. It makes the efforts of the Rebels in the OT seem pointless. It makes TFA seem worse than it was, by offering no payoff from the many loose ends Abrams' effort left. But it simultaneously improves the much-maligned prequel trilogy by comparison.The prequels got a fair bit wrong, but at least they felt part of the same universe.As a kid, I yearned for the continuation of the Skywalker saga.

Then there is the idea that a ship that enters split stream can destroy several star destroyers and the main flag ship. Not to mention the horrible ship captain that flew that ship, who instead of just telling her plan to poe she proceeded to hide it, with obvious attempts of forced feminism with the idea that \"men aren\\'t always right\" vibe, when really she should of just told him the plan (Which it self was flawed).

I'm known for longwindedly bissecting films, film is my thing (well and writing), I have an encyclopaedic knowledge dating back to my first experience in the cinema at the tender age of six.I was going to bisect this film, lay out all its too many to fit in a short list flaws, despite the fact that I realised that that might take an inordinate amount of time. In December I was angry enough, even threatening to write a fanfiction alternative to that film that I had so much of a hard time digesting.As the film came close to finishing I remember sighing and thinking, 'Well wasn't that awful? Hope the next one is better.' Then, without any setup that this might happen, the most important character who has ever existed in the Star Wars universe puffed out of existence. For no reason he was killed off with a touch of awful unfinished CGI that looked like it had been pasted on the end.At first I was in denial, I told myself I'd seen it wrong. Then two lines of dialogue between Rey and Leia confirm it, although interestingly I believe those lines were ADR so possibly weren't originally intended. I wonder if there was a meeting and they decided to kill that character just to kill his influence on the franchise, around the time Trevorrow was let go for arguing that he wanted that character alive no doubt.There are many telling details that the actor did not know their character was going to die, despite the denials of this by almost everybody involved. It seems obvious to me they didn't, that their reaction was my reaction when they first saw the film - denial to anger (pointed in Johnson's direction). As I'm sure you know denial and anger are the first two stages of grief.Anyway, this is coming from a writer: I have never seen/heard a less dramatically effective screenplay as I did when I went to see this film. The position it has left the Star Wars franchise in is irrecoverable without even more stretches of logic.Rian Johnson is a poor writer. I've looked at more of his other work since, I had only seen Looper which I thought was fairly decent until the third act when it 'diverged'. His other stuff though? Meh. Who said he was good writer? Why did they trust him with this and can't anyone at Lucasfilm read?No more Star Wars, I don't really fancy an Indy V, you've basically just killed your fanbase. I will always have the original trilogy of films, the perfect Empire Strikes Back, the not so perfect Return Of The Jedi and the original film. I didn't care about those characters because I was first introduced to them as a child, I cared about them because they were likable and their decisions made sense - I could get behind the characters.There's no getting behind the characters in this, they all act illogically and inconsistently. People tell me this is the 'SJW agenda'. I had to Google SJW. I've followed the back and forth and given my opinion for the past six months. I'm over anger now and I'm at acceptance.RIP Star Warsfor me: 24th October 1982 - 14th December 2017May the Force be with you...\",\n",

The buildup from the previous movie was for naught, there were so many things thrown in at random without getting explained what it actually was. People showing up at random at the exact perfect spot for them to be in. Others giving the spotlight for about one minute or less before getting blasted to pieces.

And to be fair The Last Jedi (TLJ) looks and sounds pretty good with an overall decent performance from the cast inherited from the mediocre The Force Awakens (TFA). So much so, that my initial reaction after leaving the theatre was \"That was OK I suppose. Not great, but watchable.\" I maybe rated it 6/10 as a popcorn movie, but 4/10 as a Star Wars movie. The professional critics seem to have left their critical faculties at the popcorn counter because there\\'s no way TLJ was a 90% fresh film!But every time I thought about it after that, or discussed it with friends, the more I realised it was just shiny Star Wars-like gloss over yawning holes in its structure &amp; foundations, and the more I disliked it. Months later, while I didn\\'t particularly like TFA, I actively hate TLJ because it\\'s one vast chasm of missed opportunities and disrespect of the characters and history of this beloved franchise :( It\\'s now a 1/10 for me.TFA was Abrams\\' usual pastiche of better past films. He\\'s very good at casting actors, and has a strong pacey visual direction, but he and his writers can\\'t write a coherent story and usually fail to have really good endings. He\\'s only interested in the next cool set piece, and isn\\'t concerned with how to connect them in a satisfying way. But he does at least get the \"feel\" of the films he\\'s emulating.In TLJ, there are so many plot holes, discontinuities, examples of bad dialogue, weird editing choices, inconsistent characterisation, deus ex machinas, violations of established story universe, incredibly weak new characters, an illogical &amp; timewasting side plot while cutting an emotional shot for pacing(!), failure to make a middle film of a trilogy, failure to develop characters from TFA, the lack of any sense of mysticism or mythic scale, that there are Youtube videos that literally take 5 hours to list all the writing crimes in this film. Johnson should never have been allowed to put this first draft script into production. I completely agree with most of those video criticisms.But it\\'s the tone deaf and ill timed comedy, and the sheer disrespect shown to the Original Trilogy (OT) characters, OT &amp; TFA actors, and lifelong fans of the nearly 40 years of lore before it, that hurts the most. This must be the only film that has ever made me truly angry at the filmmakers. Johnson started from the position of subverting expectations for all the questions left hanging in TFA. That can be a great writing technique in the hands of a competent writer. The problem is that Johnson fundamentally misunderstands the concept. It only works if the subversion replaces the expectation with something better, and yet completely fitting in the story universe. Replacing it with nothing or nobody isn\\'t subversion, it\\'s stupid &amp; lazy.Rian takes major OT supporting characters and reduces them to the tiniest bit players, plot devices and a chauffeur in space, and he sends off poor Carrie Fisher in the most unintentionally funny (bad) way. But it\\'s his disgraceful, arrogant treatment of Luke Skywalker (and Mark Hamill) that seals this film as the worse episode of the franchise. A disillusioned old Luke is a potentially interesting new direction, but we don\\'t get any believable journey that bridges the giant gap between the Luke of Return of the Jedi to this nihilistic hobo. What we get are deeply unconvincing flashbacks and voiceover which go completely against Luke\\'s earlier well established character. And after 2.5 hours we get a hugely disappointing anti-climactic ending to the Skywalker saga, with virtually nothing to look forward to in Episode 9.Mark Hamill said it best in several interviews, and maybe he knows Luke better than Rian ever could! Just Youtube search \"All 50+ times Mark Hamill tried to subtly warn us about Star Wars The Last Jedi\".\"When I read Eight I told Rian I fundamentally disagree with virtually everything you\\'ve decided about my character ...\"\"... I was very surprised and I have to tell you and I should have realized that when I read Seven I said I love everybody\\'s part except mine and on on this one it was similar in the sense that I said to Rian I\\'m so surprised how you see Luke ...\"\"... I almost had to think of Luke as another character, maybe he\\'s Jake Skywalker, he\\'s not my Luke Skywalker ...\"The thought of a Rian Johnson trilogy when, in his own words, he doesn\\'t even understand what made Star Wars what it was, makes me ill.',\n",

Stories that, even though the story in itself might age, the message never grows old.And then there is Star Wars: The Last Jedi. In this new 'Star Wars' universe obviously any random teenager off the street with access to Google can be a hero (read: jedi). No need for knowledge (read: Luke) before wisdom. No need for practice before mastery. No need for sacrifice before greatness.It also seems that a great deal of misguided contemporary gender and racial politics has been added to the mix, a surefire way to prevent any story in becoming a timeless classic. And don't even get me started on the overarching story and its sub-plots.However, all of this is OK in my book. If you wanna make forgettable experiences, Hollywood, then make forgettable experiences.But why, oh why, do you feel the need to take a dump on my childhood heroes in the process?You turned Mad Max into a wining bag of blood plasma.

Part of the Star Wars Extended Universe, there was a super compelling continuation of Luke, Han, Leia, Jedi/Sith, The Force, etc, that was super epic.Disney had a real chance to do some magic. I think with the films/TV shows they have done that are still in the original canon, they did a great job. All they had to do was film it and put it out there. But with the stuff they are replacing the EU with, Disney just came right in a took a dump all over that. Lucas did do some strange work with the prequels, but at least they were still canon. The last Jedi is so full of WTF moments. Especially what they did to Luke, and how they justified it. It would have made more sense and far more accepting if the movie had been about Luke restarting the Jedi academy and seeing his star pupil fall to the dark side. Loosing his way, and goign into hiding. That is kind of important dont you think? We are talking about Luke Skywalker. Disney just crapped on the legacy of Star Wars with this mess.The crazy crazy.... Dat ship battle chase premise? In Space once you have forward momentum, you could turn off your engine and just continue moving forward. In this movie, when the fuel(that is a whole nother wtf) runs out, the ships list over, haha.

Can't even go there right now.I can't take kylo ren serious at all. When he first appeared in that other travesty, I thought abotu Grandmas Boy( i am a robot). That was the end of kylo ren being considered a legit darksider.Rey could have really been a cool character, but there is just no sensible protagonist arch there. It is totally ridiculous nonsense.

Just scrap this trilogy and focus on making new Star Wars movies that's not connected to the 6 original films. Then they can experiment until they get it right.The directors of Rogue One and Solo did more or less stay true to Star Wars but the stories are not necessary to tell. Lucasfilm Story Group have a span of over 200 000 years to make Star Wars films so why milk a story that's already been told? And for those who think that all the complaints have anything to do with the female characters in the new movies, please google Satele Shan (she is basically a human Yoda and the Grand Master of the Jedi Order during the Old Republic era) together with her mother Bastila they are 2 of the best written Star Wars characters ever created. Just saying.\",\n",
       " \"Where do i start..First up, I get the need to have movies with strong female leads. But this is ridiculous. A Mary Sue who can do absolutely EVERYTHING??? COME ON!!! the Rey character is an expert pilot without any training, an expert aircraft technician without any training, a jedi master able to defeat trained soldiers without ANY training.. and did she actually beat luke skywalker to the ground with just a few moves on acchto?? Why do we need any of the other characters????Which brings me to point 2. Seriously, did we actually need any of the other characters?? What did they actually contribute to the plot?? Po's ideas all failed and didnt have any impact.. Finn and Rose's esacapade achievd absolutely nothing.. Luke simply showed up did a few one liners and died and Leia simply sat around with a walking stick most of the time. If they just had Rey (and maybe Kylo for the boss fight) they would have saved a whole load of cash AND it would have been more than enough to achieve the plot... to show how AWESOME Rey is...The other plotholes about the chase scene has been spoken about enough so I wont go into them here,...And finally, to praise Daisy R's wooden and emotionless performance like so many on the internet are doing I think is a slap in the face of the rest of the cast whose acting was the only saving grace in this disaster.All in all, I wish I was a star wars movie writer... All I have to do is rehash the original trilogy and I can make loads of cash and be a critic's darling.. sigh..\",\n",
       " 'Star Wars - the Last Jedi is one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. It is terrible. The acting, the directing, and of course the insipid screenplay, all sink to rock bottom, even for a bloated Hollywood blockbuster. As a published film critic with many years experience, I have seldom been more angry at a Hollywood studio for producing such a tiresome, confusing and indeed boring mess. Let\\'s be straightforward: I squirmed through the entire two and a half hours of anyone\\'s waste of time and money, from the grammatically-challenged opening crawl to the ridiculous (and mindlessly telegraphed) anti-climax. Watching this movie was worse than having teeth pulled, it was the long, gut-wrenching and bloody agony of recovery afterwards. Above all, this Disney-produced mess was a cinematic embarrassment. At least with the absurd Marvel movies we have costumed heroes to root for, and our own world to fret about. Who could care less about the anonymous locations and bland characters of this latest assembly-line installment of the redoubtable Lucasfilm franchise? George Lucas once stated the Star Wars movies were made for kids. Watching The Last Jedi as an adult is a stupefying experience, leaving one wondering if any adult had anything to do with its writing or direction. Indeed, the movie feels as if a sugar-hyped horde of grade schoolers mismanaged the entire enterprise. A film criticism usually begins with generalities of story and character and then moves on to critique specific aspects of the production, picking out special moments and positive components while throwing in a few negative zingers to entertain the reader. The Last Jedi is so completely bad I cannot comment on a single good scene. I cannot think of one. Not one. What else can I say? I suppose the visual effects were effectively \"awesome,\" but in a cinematic universe filled with black holes of plot, character and storytelling there can be no purchase. I was adrift watching this disaster - as any mature adult should be - so perhaps the only compliment I can pay to the production is \"better luck next time.\" The problem with that is Jedi follows on the heels of the clichéd A New Hope remake The Force Awakens, which at least introduced new characters and planetscapes. The Last Jedi is so bereft of original thought and design, it makes The Force Awakens look like a brilliant new concept by comparison.Still, as critic, I have a job to do -Star Wars - The Last JediTEN WORST CINEMATIC MOMENTS10) The Vietnamese space plumber kisses Finn. WTF???9) Vice-Admiral Dern suddenly becomes a hero. Wasn\\'t she supposed to be a villain? Or at least a traitor?8) The strange little bartender from TFA makes a sad, confused, animated cameo. Again, WTF??7) The opening crawl. I mean, really, how much did they spend on this disaster, a quarter of a billion dollars, and they couldn\\'t hire a high school English teacher to check the language and punctuation?6) The telegraphed meaning of the \"bloody\" footwork on the red salt planet. So we can figure out Luke is not really there. A perfect example of the movie\\'s messy confusion.5) All those amazing dialogue rip offs from other Star Wars flicks. Kylo/Ben: \"Join me and we\\'ll bring order to the universe.\" Seriously? Bring order to your haircut, Driver.4) Speaking of Ben/Kylo - Adam Driver is astonishingly bad in this movie. As if Francis Coppolla directed him from a trailer next door. Cinema fans know this reference.3) The bad acting overall. At least Daisy gives it her best. Everyone else phones it in (yes, you, Benecio) or seems to have been hired right off of Hollywood Boulevard. More evidence of an absentee director. 2) The comic relief moments that were only painful. My favorite is when the Yoda ghost chides Luke for not having really read the Jedi text. A work sacred to acolytes that is actually unreadable? Sounds like Mein Kampf.1) I could put the anti-climactic ending here, the rip off - er, reference to - The Empire Strikes Back, with the rebels in disarray and a black-clad evil avenger on their trail, but why ignore the best of the worst? The whole casino sequence! A hapless, CGI-stuffed \"reference\" to a James Bond movie, with gambling and shooting and car chases and \\'SPLOSIONS - with a few alien critters thrown in for (bad) measure. So stunningly unnecessary it boggles the mind. All for a Benecio cameo.Okay, we had our fun. Now let us put blame where blame is due. They all deserve it.Kathleen Kennedy is a corporate suit with decades of producing clichéd rip-offs of better works from the past, who could care less about storytelling and character craft. Her concern is the bottom line. Period. Reducing a beloved film series to an assembly line process, and a greedy accountant\\'s wet dream, seems to be her entire goal. Running former series characters and storylines through a crass corporate machine, allowing broken cogs and cracked wheels to work them over, is no problem for such a suit. Congratulations, Kathy, you got a Yugo. As for the man credited with \"directing\" this dreadful mess, his name deserves no mention, neither praise or contempt will he receive from me for a complete absence from this production (and the fact anyone would allow such an talentless amateur to \"create\" more series movies only proves Hollywood to be the artistic hell with which most of us are very familiar). Let us focus our blame on J. J. Abrams. Why? He produced the insipid faux SF TV series Lost, where a muddled mess of storyline was legendary. He ruined Star Trek with two blatantly unimaginative TV movie-style rip offs of third tier SF genre junk. His complete lack of creativity is self-evident in everything he does. The Force Awakens was a blatant remake of A New Hope, and he did not care. Perhaps he\\'s a devil, ruining franchise after franchise, stacking up piles of shekels as he goes. Just have him move on to the Marvel universe and get it over with for goodness sakes. Perhaps he can have Robert Downey Jr. play Sherlock Holmes as Iron Man, a steampunk kind of thing. I\\'m sure the pork-bellied Comic Con fanboys would eat it up.Lastly, there\\'s Disney. This big business behemoth inches forward through profitability by consuming other companies and better artists ideas. Without Grimm\\'s fairy tales they would have been out of business way back with Steamboat Willie. Instead, they stagger onwards, spending billions acquiring Marvel and Lucasfilm, merging it all into a gargantuan postmodern corporate octopus with its slimy, Lovecraftian tentacles penetrating all of mass media. Their only concern is crass corporate survival, so they can continue to regurgitate (ie remake/reboot/re-\"imagine\") the same stories and movies ad infinitum ad nauseum. Selling tickets is nothing compared to hawking plastic trinkets in warehouse stores. Disney extracts their consumer \"entertainment tax\" and the willing masses have no problem capitulating. Selling McDonald\\'s happy meals is the end all of this entire cinematic enterprise. Finally, how about the fans? Many hated this movie and deservedly so, but mostly because of the way the studio suits treated the Luke Skywalker character. His story arc finished with Jedi. That was thirty-five years ago! I am quite over his character. Folks, you get the movies you deserve. You continue to pay for stinky fish, you keep getting stinky fish. It\\'s that simple. Let\\'s face it, most Star Wars fans don\\'t know (or don\\'t care) that George Lucas ripped off countless other, better fantasy and science fiction for A New Hope (which I will always refer to as Star Wars). Has any of you fanboys/girls actually seen Kurosawa\\'s The Hidden Fortress? Cinema is dead. The digital age (among other worse things, like crass mass media corporatism) killed it. As long as studio bosses and their empty suit minions greenlight assembly-line superhero movies, and the fans pay for it, nothing will change. When a movie as supremely awful as The Last Jedi makes bank, the bankers smile - and cinema never rises from the dead. Long live cinema.',\n",
       " \"I've been a Star Wars fan my entire life and I'm 37, and I had such great hopes when I heard Disney was gonna continue the Skywalker saga. Instead all I've got from this movie and the last is a big broken heart! They have trashed the whole thing by making these last two movies!! Just goes to show that all Disney cares about is the almighty dollar! If they truly cared about the franchise they would have kept Lucus on as consultant and went with his ideas for the continuation of the saga! Now that I've said my piece on to my review:The Last Jedi was cinamatically a good movie. Lots of bright shiny lights and one liners for humor. Otherwise, Luke Skywalker milking a beast for blue milk!!! Really, was that necessary?? Just about lost my dinner to that scene. Then Leia flying through space using force powers she's never showed any signs of!! Give me a break! And then you go and kill Snoke without even an idea of who the heck he was or where he came from and why his force power is so strong. THENNNN, to cap it all off,... you go and kill off Luke Skywalker!!! That's the last straw!!! Even if that was ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, it shouldn't have happened until the last film, if at all! If I knew then, what I know now, I would've been very satisfied with Episode 6 being the last Star Wars movie in the Skywalker saga.\",\n",
       " 'I have never written a review before, but after 5 months of deliberation I felt compelled to express my sincere disappointment at this film. I genuinely feel that this film has single handedly ended the Star Wars saga, and in the most disheartening way possible.Everything about this film was wrong. The choices made were so poorly considered. All of the good work by JJ Abrams on the Force Awakens was undone by this film. He must be devastated to see what has happened, and to learn what he now has to work with for the final episode.From the \"new\" powers, to the woeful \"comedy\" moments, to the complete disregard of the character history and Star Wars mythology, to irrelevant plot lines, to the complete waste of characters old and new, the whole thing was a shambles.This film as a film, is ok. This film as a continuation of the Star Wars saga is dreadful. I didn\\'t think there could be a worse film in the cannon than the Phantom Menace, but the treatment of Luke and Leia are the trump points.I understand from the IMDb trivia page for the film that after reading the script for the film, Mark Hamill told director Rian Johnson, \"I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you\\'ve made for this character.\" I think that pretty much sums it up.',\n",
       " \"This movie destroyed the Star Wars universe. The director used beloved characters to preach a socially conscious, politically-correct liberal message. In the Empire Strikes Back Yoda says that the dark side is bad and even a little bit of darkness will ruin your life. In this movie Yoda seems to agree with the director that The Force needs a balance of light and dark and the true path of enlightenment is a mix of the two. I guess that would be true if the film were directed by Satan. Star Wars was an epic space opera about heroes and villains and light defeating darkness and now it's about veganism, socialism, feminism and embracing your dark side.\",\n",

May the Force be with US ALL, and We need it, watching this boom-boom-action S.W. clones :-(\",\n",
       " 'OK, this movie wasn\\'t ALL bad. The cinematography is amazing. I enjoyed the scenes with \"Luke\", mostly, even though I agree with everyone who says it was a huge misuse of the character. Everyone who says it was original is dead wrong. (Rebel base discovered, which leads to a long chase through space, where a scoundrel betrays our heroes, while the young protagonist gets trained by a wise old Jedi culminating in a duel with the Bad Guy who makes a big reveal. Uhg - seriously?) Mark Hamill (Not really Luke.) makes a good, dramatic exit. Easily an hour could have been cut (the absurd side-plot) and I wouldn\\'t have nearly fallen asleep watching this. I am annoyed that Johnson didn\\'t follow the original arc of the story, but I could say the same about Abrams. Did they have a plan for these movies at all?? It sure doesn\\'t seem like it. Lucas may be a terrible director/ writer, but he\\'s an incredible ideas guy - he probably should have been listened to as far as the original story was conceived. The Force Awakens was executed fairly well, but it also had huge problems, so ultimately this trilogy can not be fixed, no matter what they end up doing with IX. (Maybe a scene where Luke wakes up and it was all a bad dream? I\\'d take that.)',\n",
       " 'Most other reviews accurately capture everything wrong with this disappointing, garbage film. However, allow me to offer a different perspective. Think back to before you actually saw this movie, and forget the Force Awakens for a minute; If someone were to tell you that the an upcoming star wars movie you are about to see is going to consist of the following in the script:Starting off with a your mama jokeAn 18 hour \"run them out of gas\" crawl paced chase, bad guys chasing the good guysAn 18 hour crawl where the bad guys, so vast and so capable that they are said to have invaded the galaxy in a few weeks, and with a dozen major ships in the vicinity, have no solution to kill off the remaining good guys primary ship other than to wait them out for the entire 18 hours.A human character survives out in the empty vacuum of space, withstanding the sudden loss of heat and pressure, floats around in space, lives, and is unharmed.Main bad guy facilitates several Skype sessions between an antagonist and our main protagonist, through the force.Two key good guy characters go to jail for parking on a beach.While their good guy friends are in desperate peril and in need of help, those same characters decide to spend precious time freeing cute space dog/horse animals from an amusement park like casino planet.A renegade protagonist of the good guys heroically preserves the remaining good guys in a critical battle but good guy military leadership demotes him. Later, he commits blatant mutiny against good guy leadership, fails and gets caught, and good guy leadership declares they like him.Our main protagonist not only gets fully trained in the ways of the force, but becomes the most powerful force user ever, more powerful than Luke and all bad guys.... by means of a 1 minute lesson from Luke, and by waiving around a lightsaber on her own for 2 minutes.The main protagonist declares of the main antagonist \"there\\'s no light left in him\", then minutes later reverses herself and declares there is light left in him.The main antagonist renounces his evil organization, then rejoins it minutes later. We learn that at some point in the recent past, our noble Luke decided to try to murder his nephew, who\\'s training to be a Jedi and who\\'s done no harm at this point, in his sleep.Our beloved Luke commits suicide by projecting a hologram of himself light years away, with the intent of delaying the bad guys by a whole 5 minutes (evidently all that was necessary to thwart the bad guys), allowing the good guys to run out the back door of a cave (which the bad guys didn\\'t think to cover). In other words, Luke\\'s kills himself with a 5 minute light show to distract the bad guys, in order to save the good guys.Luke is able to force transport Han\\'s very physical dice to Leia through light years of space because...the force.The movie culminates in the main protagonist saving the good guys by moving rocks, after earlier mocking the notion of moving rocks, because the good guys clearly had no other alternatives like shooting their way out.Luke milks a space cow.Lastly, Chewy\\'s only scene of significance is him declining to eat a chicken like animal for supper.If someone told you this was going to be in your upcoming star wars movie, your natural reaction would be \"Haha, very funny... great joke. Okay, seriously, what is this movie going to be about?\"',\n",
       " \"The best part of this movie was the end credits, that's all I have to say about this tragic addition to the Star Wars story.\",\n",

Also it spits on the universe 40 years in the making. The plot makes zero sense. The characters only serve as puppets of forced political views. It's not new, it's not brave, it's not modern. Only stupid and egoist.Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy think they know better than you, than millions and millions of fans. Even Mark Hamill was against all this, but he had already signed the contract before he saw the script. It's so sad he had to assist all this.The fans only hope is now that more and more people would awake and boycott these no talent hacks to prevent them doing more damage on the franchise.

       " \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a cinematic event unlike anything. The buzz it created from the moment its first teaser went live resulted in a blockbuster release that shattered many box-office records during its theatrical run and gave the fans &amp; newcomers their money's worth of big-budget extravaganza. It was also the first Star Wars film that I actually enjoyed watching.The onus was now on Rian Johnson who was entrusted with the next episode in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. There's no denying that the middle chapter is always the hardest but where many detractors complained that The Force Awakens didn't do anything different from the norm, what Johnson does here is only gonna make them wish they could take it all back.Set in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Last Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi) follows two simultaneously unfolding storylines. One concerns Rey who has finally found Luke Skywalker who helps her develop her newly discovered abilities. The other segment follows The First Order that has the Resistance on its last legs.Written &amp; directed by Rian Johnson (best known for Looper), The Last Jedi deviates a tad too far from the course in its attempt to do something different. Full of pacing &amp; tonal issues, Episode VIII is a convoluted mess from start to finish but what sucks about it is that most of its shortcomings were easily rectifiable, all it needed was more refined script &amp; tighter editing.Another issue is that it fails to integrate new characters into its universe. Add to that, there is an entire subplot that it could have done without. The humour is jarring &amp; falls flat most times. There is no consistency between its flow of events. And some decisions make no sense whatsoever. There is nothing wrong in taking a different route as long as it all adds up and in this film's case, it doesn't.Coming to the acting department, the best performance comes from Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker better than he ever did before. Daisy Ridley builds on her last act to deliver another strong performance as Rey, Adam Driver embraces the dark side as Kylo Ren, and the chemistry between him &amp; Rey carries a spark. Amongst the new additions, Kelly Marie Tran as Rose is absolutely cringeworthy.On an overall scale, Star Wars: The Last Jedi fails to make the most of the strong foundation that was provided to it by The Force Awakens, and is a disappointing episode that suffers from Rian Johnson's unfocused direction &amp; unrefined script. Somewhere within this film lies a highly gripping &amp; endlessly riveting adventure fantasy that would've satisfied most. Biting off more than it can chew, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is different for the sake of being different.\",\n",

I did all I could to avoid reading reviews and/or seeing spoilers. I was excited to see another \"great\" Star Wars film but THIS? This was a disaster.

What will Luke do with the lightsaber that Rey hands him? Etc..Nothing and I mean nothing is answered in the way they set it up. The plot is a total mess with sidestories that are there just for the political message. I guess the most important thing for Disney in this was to destroy the old. Make \\'Luke Skywalker - the Jedi hero\\' into an old grumpy man so that the new turds in town Rey and Kylo will look as powerful gods. Rey beats Luke in combat?! Yeah right. And when grumpy Luke finally accepts to train Rey and he leaves after two minutes with the words that he\\'s only seen such brute force one time before and that is Ben Solo.

That doesn\\'t make any sense and sounds like the least \"Luke Skywalker thing\" to do. And the way they decide to kill off Luke was just horrible. Vanishing away on a rock looking into the sun? I guess the mega force projection was to much for his male body and mind to handle. Awful writing!And what is up with hand puppet Joda? He lightning strikes trees on fire though he supposed to be a force ghost. He also declares that the Jedi books contains great wisdom but nothing that Rey doesn\\'t already know. Probably cause she\\'s a woman. And Snoke, this evil powerful creature gets killed like a jackass with no backstory on who he was or where he came from??? You learned nothing on how he\\'s trained Kylo or how he managed to turn him to the dark side. I don\\'t even care if Snoke\\'s death was fake or not (oh you\\'re so clever Rian Johnson) and that he will turn up in ep 9. We were supposed to get some frekkin answers by this movie. Leia flying in space is the most bizarre thing I\\'ve ever seen. Ok we know she is force sensitive but to actually fly like superman when she is blown out of the ship is so stupid. But she\\'s a woman! Admiral \"Powerpuff\" Holdo refuses to tell Poe the plan which leads us to operation find the code breaker. The whole casino-town part was so so boring and did nothing for the story. I guess the point was to make a stand against capitalism and evil white men with money. What a waste of an hour.

       " \"I'm struggling to understand the plethora of positive ratings and reviews for TLJ. As a stand alone sci-fi movie, TLJ hits many marks and could be quite enjoyable if viewed objectively.Therein lies the problem. The Star Wars saga is a very personal subject to so many people. It has spanned generations. It evokes childhood memories and family Christmases. It formed the platform for a whole life of 'Geek-dom' for many of us, and will never be replaced or replicated.I just thought it was, quite frankly, dull. How much screen time was spent looking at Carrie Fisher's one and only facial expression? Her acting ability was limited to say the least and although we absolutely needed a concrete link to the past historic saga, why focus so much on her?The whole movie was once again played out in a tried and tested format: Rebels are in the minority and on the brink, a few heroes step to the plate and risk all to prevent a major and irreversible tragedy. All the while, a story about the power between the light and dark is played out to various degrees of effectiveness. You've seen it all before.I think my biggest complaint was the lack of a real menace with sinister edge. This aspect is what absolutely nailed the original movies. The Emporer and Vader would have me struggling to sleep at night. Snoke and Ren just don't hold the same level of darkness. They don't scare me. Their power doesn't leave me in awe. We needed more Dark Side development in this second installment. Where's Snoke's back story? His Sith title? We barely saw him in FA and now's he's gone without hardly a whimper. Not good enough.This movie has been 100% 'played safe'. After all, what director will risk their reputation on taking a risk with the biggest ever movie franchise? Their stock would plummet if a failure. We had this with FA.This ranks as joint last with PM in order of ratings. At least PM was slightly redeemed with Darth Maul. TLJ was cute and fluffy, clearly attempting to capture a junior fan base away from Marvel and DC. Hardcore fans of the saga prepare to be disappointed.\",\n",

HOWEVER, this film comes under the star wars banner and to put it simply is not a star wars film. It tries to be an action comedy, jokes are thrown at you all the time and I personally found myself not laughing at one. I was sitting there as the film not only contradicts itself (E. G. Failures are the biggest lesson followed by giving up on life and joining the force) but every other star wars film. What can't the force and hyper space solve? I can't think of anything. The space chase an makes zero sense as the first order has ships that it can send ahead at light speed but chooses not to because... Instead of looking for faster ships to evacuate the fleeing resistance ship, the plan was to hack into the tracker of snokes destroyer? No wonder there's only 400 surviving in the resistance at that point. The characters are dull and everyone has a cringey moment cracking wise. There's literally no consequences for any of the characters decisions. Ray goes in to the dark side cave and faces no backlash. The kids openly free the animals in front of there masters and face no punishment. The character that takes over Leia for some reason keeps her flying straight plan a secret (the worst tactic ever btw) a mutiny ensues and nobody strips any one of these weapons and they just hold them there in the middle of a busy hanger for no reason apart from so they can escape easily. For some reason it was a genius move to completely pave over what happened in the force awakens and openly mock dedicated star wars fans by telling the audience how stupid it is. I have no idea how this got through the board room. Probably because they are trying to net the biggest audience possible from the already biggest movie franchise ever. I hope it fails. I won't see another Disney movie. Marvel, Pixar, starwars it all lines the pockets of people who don't care about movies. It's all about money and selling the merchandise. One quick note Rose that character who literally dies and is brought back magically is my least favorite part of the last Jedi. Mary Poppins Leia was stupid but they could of made it work if the rest didn't sell itself out soo much.

The force awakens created some mysteries about 1)rey's parent's , 2)snoke's origin and we get nothing..1)Rey's parents are some scum..The saga is about the family of skywalker and their connection with the force so I CAN NOT understand what they had in mind when they decided to give Rey this back story...She has no relationship with noboby from the entire saga she is just nobody..so why Han Solo in TFA seemded shock about Rey's identity??..2)Snoke , the mighty force user and the main villain of the sequel trilogy is killed in the middle of the movie and furthermore we get no info about his identity , his coflict with Luke , his origin story..so the mystery about him its pointles..The thing that i also didn't lke were the jokes...Disney should hane known that STAR WARS IS NOT AVengers.There many forced jokes that shouldn't exist..Rey gives the lightsaber to Luke and he throws it away?? come ...its hilarious.....In addition the casino worl is out of star wars...it reminds me somthing of star trek and battlestar galactica...its a world that we have never seen in star wars universe and i think it was out of space and time ...The script was awful (FUELS ???? !! )....Luke skywalker isn't what we have been waiting for and he dies alone (like solo ) without glory...I give it one star because Disney doen't care about star wars but she does care about making money...the movie prepares us for more movies of the expanded universe and fails to continue the magic of Star Wars..\",\n",
       " 'The Force Awakens was a triumph in re-kindling our passion and thirst for more Star Wars epic adventures and our need to continue that adventure with The Last Jedi is sadly taken away with this pitiful instalment.The plot has all the makings of a classic Star Wars movie. The Resistance on it\\'s knees with all hope seemingly lost. The First Order tightening it\\'s grip and closing in with brand new modern Star Destroyers, chasing the Resistance through the galaxy in an old Ford Cortina and a spud gun for protection all thrown together with a bit of Jedi stardust.But from the opening scene with the cheesy \" yes I\\'ll hold\" phone joke the only thing that was missing was the hold music!!!!!! From there it just get worse and worse with infinite bad comedy throughout the film for what can only be described as cheap laughs which totally ruined it. There is so much to say which I won\\'t as everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I can only describe this as a when Star Wars met Harry Potter movie.So disappointed !!!!!',\n",
       " 'Reducing Star Wars to an entertainment film only, after the work that George Lucas has done (of research and writing) is absolutely simplistic; work that had always been reffered to the studies of the anthropologist J. Campbell, for example. Let\\'s be clear: I don\\'t say that there\\'s no attempt in The Last Jedi to relate to the great anthropological issues (which have always characterized the franchise) such as the overcoming of paternal hegemony, but, the few things that may have worked, have been sacrified in the name of childish jokes and grotesque situations. Giving the peculiar explanation of why Kylo Ren turned evil, by the way, was the only thing that may have really surprised in the movie, on which base, could have been settled a better plot. The main issue of The Last Jedi, in fact, is the total lack of a solid narrative structure and filmic logic, which, at least, had always characterized George Lucas storytelling, from the very early beginning. Anyway, Star Wars means a lot of things for billions of people all over the world. Thus, killing what it represents in the deep and hoping that everything would be fine, sounds like an insult to mankind intelligence. When someone has the honor and the privilege of putting hands on masterpieces that have revolutionized the American film industry, first of all, he must understand in which kind of franchise he is working on and so follow certain unwritten rules. For example, If I\\'m writing for the TV show \"The Walking Dead\", I can not let Zombies eat candies, instead of human brains. This is the reason why Rian Johnson can not talk about \"gray shades\" in a world where there has always been a such clear gap between good and evil (despite history teaches:\"only a Sith deals in absolute...\") or He can not force Luke Skywalker to act such as a dull boy, when he\\'s always been the opposite in terms of character\\'s personality. If you twist the founding elements of a saga, you\\'re not innovative, you\\'re just a fool. Just remember that, if you\\'re staging a famous opera, you can, of course, change the set up and the lights, but not the basic contents; otherwise it would be like drawing, on top of Mona Lisa\\'s head, hornes: a sterile, but fun, provocation ... just like The Last Jedi.',\n",

       " 'The 8th chapter in the newly resurrected Star Wars series, is a rollercoaster of an adventure, filled with the unexpected fun, twist and turns that have been delightfully introduced by Rian Johnson. What you would expect is not what is given to you, in the most whimsical Star Wars film to date.Following from the end of the Force Awakens, we find Rey attempting to bring Luke Skywalker out of hiding to help the battle against the vicious First Order, but Skywalker himself does not seek to return, as his own past has defined him as he insists on staying in the dark. Meanwhile General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) leads the resistance in escape from the First Order in deep space, where Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Hux ( Domhnall Gleeson) won\\'t rest till they are finally destroy them.As a life long Star Wars fan, it was regrettable when I went to see The Force Awakens two years ago, and coming out feeling very disappointed. After a couple more views, I have been able to enjoy the film, but still find several issues with it, that haven\\'t made it the Star Wars film for me. I have to admit though that the ending, with reveal of Rey\\'s power and that final appearance of Mark Hamil did have me anticipating in glee for the next chapter of the series. With a darker appearance than the previous film, and a different director: Rian Johnson, I have been very excited about the promise of The Last Jedi.As the caption \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away\" emerged I had a sudden shiver of joy (as did it last time). Unfortunately soon after, I found myself thinking its was going in the same direction of the Force Awakens, with the same issues occurring.We start with a rather choppy beginning in the establishment of our characters, that created a great disturbance in the balance of things. This was only pre-mature but stood out to ne. Again we have frequent moments of on the nose dialogue, that may sound good on paper, but through certain delivery is not. There is also have middle subplot with Finn (Jon Boyega) and new rebel character Rosa ( that doesn\\'t really land on its feet and eventually becomes a waste of time just to fit into the 152 minute runtime.We furthermore have the return of the endless string of laugh out loud jokes and quirks that turn it almost into comedy, charming to some maybe, but not for this fan. Star Wars at its core is film about the struggle of good vs evil which I and I\\'m sure many fans take seriously, but its very hard to take it serious if the film isn\\'t half the time. Its not just the cute humour with BB-8 but there are times during critical conversation, that it appears a custard pie has to be thrown. I know if you take any Marvel film you could pick out a hundred moments of humour, but there\\'s something about the humour in the latest Star Wars films, which just ruins it for me, it pulls me out of this fantasy and draws attention to the artificial construction.That being said what Star Wars The Last Jedi wonderfully succeeds as a fun, action pack, adventure, character drama, and I am over joyed to say for myself, as a Star Wars film.A Bold and original take for the Star Wars series, The Last Jedi at last becomes its very own film, in a inventive war drama, taking you places you would never expect to find yourself. From a brilliant dramatic tension between, Rey and Luke, to Ren\\'s desperation to prove himself to Supreme Leader Snoke, and the resistance struggling to work cooperatively against the First Order. This is mostly held together by Mark Hamill\\'s stand out performance as the broken Jedi master, in his heart-rendering eyes and stares, Hamill, perfectly embodies an aging Skywalker, lost of hope for the rest of the galaxy. This is the key heart that drives the soul of the film. Furthermore Driver brings a much stronger an more powerful performance in Kylo Ren, especially when opposite his counterpart Rey, with Daisy Ridley also bringing a more thriving performance.Of course opposite Johnson\\'s brialliant storytelling, is a range of fantastic action, including some sensational space dog fights, planet battles and as always exhilarating lighsaber battles. The Last Jedi, almost never rests in its continuous array of action making it one of the most action packed Star Wars films yet.What I wanted for The Force Awakens is exactly what I got in the Last Jedi with its own story, still with certain shouts to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but still a new chapter to remember. As also similar to last year\\'s spin off film Rogue One, The Last Jedi, properly begins and ends with a monumental final third act This is where the new Star Wars era finally become Star Wars for me. The film represents the change and innovation which the filmmakers are presumably planning to bring into a new Star Wars generation.Star Wars The Last Jedi has now thankfully awakened the force in me, as to appreciate this new Star Wars era. It does still suffer from a several flaws within narrative structure, and my personal quarrels, but managed to bring out the real Star Wars fan in me. An incredible and enjoyable watch, The force is very strong with this one.',\n",
       " 'To sum it up, that is the first time in my life I have left a Star Wars movie and felt depressed and sad. Normally these films are so much fun and full of positive energy, but Last Jedi is just the opposite. It is pointless and effectively killing the whole saga for \"legacy fans\". The GoodThe acting, the special effects and the score. From the technical point of view, Last Jedi is a master piece and will literally blow you away. It is amazing, how good effects can be. Mark Hammil and Daisy Ridley are superb and everybody else is trying to keep up. Carrie Fisher is heartwarming and here scenes with Luke are among the best you\\'ll see this year. The lightsaber battle is also among the best in Star Wars and one of the best action scenes I have seen in a while.The BadEverything story related, in every single moment the movie fails to deliver. All expectations old Star Wars fans have, are gutted. In the end, everything the old saga and JJ put in place, is dismantled. Literally so, heros and villains are as dead by the end, as is the new republic, the resistance and everything magical George Lucas ever put in Star Wars. The movie ends with a spoiled child with anger issues ruling the galaxy and a few people on an old piece of junk. How do they get there? Through immense plot holes and most likely Rian Johnson saying \"naaa to complicated to resolve, lets just kill it off\". The whole \"slow chase\" makes no sense at all, the all-powerfull new order just can\\'t order two star destroyers to make a short jump to lightspeed to put them in front of the resistance fleet? Really?The UglyApart from the milking scene and some awkward humor (a phone joke, really?), everything related to Poe and the Canto plotline. Poe single handedly destroys the meager resistance fighter force by disobeying orders. Admiral Holdo kills off, what is left, by simply not telling anybody about her plan. Seriously, that is not how military works, especially not in a resistance where trust between people is everything. Last but not least, Lukes storyline and everything force-related. No need to go into detail, Mark Hamill said already everything you have to know. The VerdictFor fans of the old saga, this is 1-2 star movie. Depends on how much you enjoy the effect work. For people starting with TFA and no idea what Star Wars was about, maybe 5-6 stars, depends on how bad you think, the plot holes are.',\n",

This is only one of the many flaws of this movie. But the biggest flaw however is how they handled Luke Skywalker, it was awful and completely out of character. They wanted to create a shock element in expense of one of the most iconic movie characters of all time, Luke Skywalker. The core trait of Luke was to never give up on people, because of this he could redeem his father in the Original Trilogy. They just ripped this trait out of the character so they could create a shock element. Why? Couldn't they come up with a more creative idea? There are a lot of fan theories created after TFA that make so much more sense and are much more coherent then what they did in TLJ.Shame on the people who concocted this.Hats off to Mark Hamill, who was still able to give a believable performance even though he couldn't find himself in the direction they choose for his character.R.I.P.

I could only give it a good rating if it was either a star wars spoof or was a general scifi movie unrelated to star wars, and even then the science flaws would give me an issue. Please note that the following paragraphs will contain some plot information.(Spoilers)Science Issues: So apparently in the star wars universe, there is no decompression when opening a ship's cargo hold to vacuum, inertial dampeners do nothing to reduce sudden motion, and a small woman can kick the frame of a ship hard enough to shake loose an item on an upper deck. Also, since when was the force usable as a space suit??? especially to one who is untrained in the force. Also, while i can see using a ship approaching super luminal speeds being used as a battering ram, since when did that slice apart over half a dozen ships outside the flight path of the ramming ship? Science based plot holes aside, we have a mary sue who apparently can defeat the strongest of the Jedi with only one day of training and who is convinced she can turn the bad guy, who was evil and committed multiple murders as a child. Apparently she forgets that any padawan that he couldnt take to Snoke he murdered and burnt in the temple. They then waste the bad guy completely without manifesting him to his full potential as a villain. And to top it off, we have Phasma, this uber storm trooper, who could have been the new Boba Fett chasing the rebellion to hell and back, wasted in a fight resulting from a pointless mission to give the diversity hire character a chance to give their backstory, be betrayed by a man, and to marginalize the black storm trooper that joined the rebellion in The Force Awakens. She not only marginalized him in the mission, but in transit and on the planet for the final battle, stopping his heroic effort to stop the first order and a weapon whose full potential he knew. And finally, in like her fifth time in her life using the force, Rey lifts a freaking landslide of boulders, which by their multitude and weight seemed like a job Luke or Yoda would have found difficult.In conclusion, even though the rebellion failed, we are supposed to be happy that it survived, even though 95% of the people that died could have been saved in a much shorter time if they had offloaded everyone onto the support ships, transfering fuel at that time as well, and then rammed snoke's ship with the flagship or if the had loaded everyone on the flagship earlier, they could have turned the support ships around and done 2 light-speed rams and then jumped away.

       " 'The Last Jedi is a cinematic garbage. It felt like I was watching a Star Wars parody and not a legitimate episode in the saga. There are stupid and misplaced jokes in almost every scene. Even the quiet scenes are mocking everything. Luke is milking an Elephant seal and then squirts blue milk into his mouth. Chewie is roasting a Porg while other Porgs watch in sadness (Supposed to be funny in Disney\\'s view). This film felt like some weird acid trip. There is no story to follow, it\\'s 2 hours and 40 minutes of pure nonsense. They ridiculed every aspect of Star Wars that we love. The Force now works like a galactic Skype to make calls between Rey and Kylo Ren. The elevator scene where Kylo Ren takes Rey to the Snoke\\'s throne room is pure shameless ROTJ ripoff ! She is handcuffed, Snoke removes those with The Force and shows her a space battle outside the window and tells her how rebel friends will die etc. I mean it was beyond ridiculous. Like if a little kid grabbed some Star Wars toys and started playing with them. The action was pointless, way too frequent and boring like hell, just trash flying on screen and things blowing up. There is no character development, no emotional resonance that would actually make you care about the characters. There is no back story, nothing is explained, the characters are as shallow as you can imagine. The Star Wars feeling is not there at all. If a film does not take itself seriously, then how can the audience do it ? It really was like Robot Chicken Star Wars spoof or some weird Star Wars Holiday Special. At Disney they mocked everything about The Force, about Jedi philosophy and Jedi training. Suddenly everyone can use The Force because in Disney\\'s view it\\'s just some crap to move things around, lift people in the air or make a free intergalactic call. George Lucas put The Force into the movie to awaken some sense of spirituality in young people. Jedi knights are like samurai or daoist or buddhist monks. It takes a lifetime of discipline, hard training, acquired wisdom and the deepest commitment to become a Jedi and to use The Force. It takes Rey about one short meditation session to become a Jedi. What they decided about Luke Skywalker is a blasphemy ! It goes against all his moral values and beliefs of a true Jedi Master. The Force Awakens started a downfall for Star Wars when they decided to not continue the story but to do the silly rehash, soft reboot of the original trilogy. George Lucas wrote a story for 7,8,9 and at Disney they betrayed him and threw it into the trash telling him: \"We want to do movie for the fans.\" George Lucas is the only one intellectually capable of making a Star Wars film. He is the creator, so he understands it the best. He worked hard to make every SW movie different, with new spectacular designs, new story elements etc. Each time he created a new universe, a visionary masterpiece and infused it with mythological, spiritual, psychological and political themes. Star Wars was always made out of many themes and dealt with issues each of us is facing in our daily lives. SW is not about space ships, action or blasters like they think it is at Disney. It\\'s much more complicated than that and Abrams, Johnson or Kennedy clearly don\\'t understand a thing about Star Wars. Disney just ruined Star Wars for good. Don\\'t support this garbage. Star Wars episodes 1-6 are canon and 7,8,9 just silly fan films. God how I wish George Lucas made 7,8,9 with his story and his vision ! The Last Jedi was probably the worst blockbuster I have ever seen. The same thing happened to Marvel movies as well - just garbage action all the time and no story or character arch. For the record The Shannara Chronicles TV series felt 1000x more like watching Star Wars than this Last Jedi piece of crap. In Shannara they worked to establish the characters and the audience cared about them. It had tons of mythological elements as well just like Star Wars. But most of all it had a STORY ..... What Disney did to Star Wars with their corporate greed can\\'t be forgiven !Watching Star Wars was always a great form of escapism and inspiration. It taught us lessons, sparked our imagination and expanded our views about the mysteries of the universe and our place in it. That was before the dark times, before the Disney.',\n",

The more I think about it, the more disappointed I get now with this film. There is so much wrong with it, its easier to focus on what actually works in the movie, and the answer is very little. Too many storylines, the whole prequel-type CGI casino scenes with Finn and Rose was not needed at all, too many unnecessary twists were the film was trying too hard to be clever, but most unforgivably - destroying Luke Skywalker's character. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters by the end of the movie. It was trying too hard to be too box-ticking PC correct too - vegetarian is good, being rich is bad, religion is bad, everyone is equal, you don't need to be a Skywalker to be a Jedi, anyone can be a Jedi, etc. Terrible film, and may actually be the worst film in the entire franchise (how is that even remotely possible after all the hard work achieved with Force Awakens and Rogue One?)\",\n",

However ( coming from a fan, whose very first film he ever watched at the cinema was A New Hope), this film has destroyed everything that Star Wars truly is.',\n",
       " \"I was hugely disappointed in this movie. There were so many failed attempts at jokes. Literally nobody in the movie theatre laughed. Pretty much everyone in this packed IMAX theatre just stayed completely silent. And that should just tell you enough about how much this movie sucked.It's like they never knew what tone to go for. During most scenes I just felt bored or really confused, because the scenes that were supposed to be dramatic suddenly turned into a cringy joke. Like that scene where Rey hands Luke the lightsaber and he just throws it over his shoulder. It just left me so confused, thinking; Wait, were we supposed to laugh here?There were just so many weird and confusing moments in this movie, like when Leia survived that huge explosion and then flew like Superman through space, or how the all-powerful Snoke didn't even sense a lightsaber moving right next to him.I also thought it was so disappointing that Luke is so much out of character in this movie and is just this grumpy old man who never leaves that goddamn island. And the other characters aren't really well written either and it all just resulted in me not really caring that much about them at all, even though I wanted to. And the porgs were not even cute, just super annoying.I do not recommend seeing this movie, as I now feel that Star Wars has died. R.I.P. Star Wars.\",\n",
       " 'Like The Force Awakens the film leaves me apathetic. I don\\'t hate it, but I didn\\'t enjoy it either. It\\'s well made visually, but ultimately feels very shallow. Rey is still a perfect mary sue that can do no wrong. Kylo is still a whiny emo man child who hates everything and everyone. Snoke is wasted. Luke is kinda diminished as a character in this. The story surrounding Finn/Poe/Leia/Rose feels so pointless, like it busy work until they move to the \"arena\" to watch the spectacle of the ending. There are good bits here in there, but they seem to ultimately serve a anticlimactic and boring conclusion that doesn\\'t do much in moving the plot anywhere far after the ending of the last movie.',\n",
       " \"All in all, this was not a good film. Rian Johnson tried too hard to appeal to fans, to his inner white boy teenager (by trying to make us feel empathy for Kylo Ren), and to echo the amazing grit and character introductions we saw in TFA. With so much of his focus on these aspects, it appears he forgot how to write a good plot while not twisting characters in ways that don't make sense to fit what he wanted. Again, this movie is what Rian Johnson wanted and thought that we as fans wanted. He failed to give what I view as true character development and honestly, the plot is right back where we started but now Luke is gone and a character we had no time to form a bond with (Holdo) is gone and were missing half of the resistance. Johnson tried to make up with his lacking skills as a director in the humor department. People were laughing every 5-10 minutes (literally). I don't remember laughing that much in ANY meaningful Star Wars movie (including Rogue One, which is one of my personal favorites). Conclusion: Reylo fanservice (needless shirtless Kylo Ren - sorry Adam Driver nothing personal just I'm not in the mood for uncooked chicken these days)character assassination of Luke (who was well aware of the pitfalls of the Jedi yet gave into the fearmongering that ruined the order in the first place in trying to kill his nephew)sidelining of important POC characters such as Finn, whose role served nothing in the movies also he didn't get to see Rey until like the last five minutes lack of character development... they haven't changed or learned from their experiences... Star Wars is about the relationships. That's why we get so attached is we see ourselves in them and quite frankly I felt nothing. I didn't even cry. amazing cast, poorly executed dialogue (under the instruction of mastermind RJ)Sigh. That's all. Sigh.\",\n",

A far cry from the soft spoken, righteous young jedi of old. The least they could have done is show him having a reconciliation meeting with Chewie and Leia (one that wasn\\'t just a projection). Also, if Luke can just force teleport anywhere, why didn\\'t he just teleport into the main command ship and find a way to blow it up? Or teleport into the lead gorilla walker and shove his lightsaber in the controls? Or into Kylo Rens ship and blow it up while it was midair? Or teleport next to the door smashing machine and hack it to bits?I could go on but I won\\'t, this movie pretty much killed the franchise for me.

       " 'The Last Jedi. With a title like that, it\\'s no surprise that Star Wars Episode VIII was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. The implications and perceived darkness of the title and trailers gave mega-fans like me more hype than we could handle, especially coming off the nostalgic and satisfying Force Awakens, which was a grand-slam commercially, critically, and most importantly: with the fans. I bought my tickets at first release, wore my favorite Star Wars shirt, and arrived at the theater expecting great things and to be blown away again.. but I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this: I left The Last Jedi disappointed &amp; feeling like I got insulted by an old friend.The movie has good visuals and a lot of action. There, those are the only pros I could think of. Now, the flaws. First and foremost: Disney-fication. I have noticed and been calling this out since the summer and how much Marvel films have changed since their Disney deal in movies like Spider-Man: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok, where it feels like Disney is trying to skew the movies towards weak-minded kid audiences who want silly jokes and fuzzy creatures instead of films that take the artform seriously or have any wit, consequence, or point to make. The SAME problem bleeds over to TLJ, even more brutal as things like Porgs (the new Jar Jar Binks as far as I\\'m concerned..), burping dwarves, Luke cracking jokes, and alien maids in nun outfits are shoved down our throats, when the film was marketed as being dark &amp; serious like Empire Strikes Back and is essentially a big lie on that front and insult to Star Wars fans who trusted it.Next, the script is a mess. I found myself thinking at several points in the film \\'Wait, this doesn\\'t make sense. No problem, they\\'ll fix it in the end.\\' But they never did. First, the entire Finn and Rose subplot is completely useless and does absolutely nothing to progress the story in any way. It feels like they just wanted to give Finn something to do &amp; fit in an Asian character to appeal to that marketplace\\'s $$$ (even more insulting). Also, the plot on the ship made NO sense. If Captain Phasma had just explained her thinking to Poe instead of leaving it muddy for dramatic effect, all would\\'ve turned out better for the Rebels instead of the disaster it did. Finally, I don\\'t think the filmmakers understand how space works (crazy to ponder as it\\'s called STAR Wars) as Leia had the perfect opportunity to have a meaningful (and well-needed after her tragic passing in real life) exit, but somehow survives being in DEAD SPACE without even a suit and swims to safety like nothing happened when science says she would\\'ve died instantly. Wow.Finally, accuracy to the Star Wars name and vision George Lucas built over 40 years. The film feels almost like a parody and betrayal of the character of Luke and the Jedi. I have to wonder if Rian Johnson even watched the original trilogy because of how different Luke is as a person, COMPLETELY flip-flopped in every way from who he is as the biggest character in the history of Star Wars, and one of the biggest characters in the history of fiction. Like I could maybe accept that isolation can change a person a little, but not this much and his explanation and reasoning made no sense and were so poorly written: Luke sensed a little darkness in my student so Luke is going to kill him and all Jedi he spent an entire Trilogy begging to be part of!!!! Also, why did Yoda come back and say Jedi need to die and go along with his reasoning (which at least would\\'ve made for a more intriguing storyline if the movie had stuck with it and ended the Jedi and tried something different), but at the end of the movie, we are in the EXACT same position narratively as when we started: The Rebellion is scrambling to survive as they\\'re being hunted down by the First Order. The only difference is *SPOILER* Luke\\'s exit, but even that lacked the true gravity and emotion that we should 100% expect from the exit of MAIN CHARACTER OF STAR WARS.In the end, (I still can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this for one of my most hyped films of the year) I left The Last Jedi disappointed and like I got let down by an old friend. The title, marketing, trailer, and \"critics\" all lied to me (Rotten Tomatoes is without doubt to me on payroll by Disney to give every one of their major releases a 90%+ (every giggly Marvel movie seems to challenge Dark Knight.., TLJ rated higher than A NEW HOPE &amp; EMPIRE), even when fans are hating it and gave it the lowest audience score in the history of Star Wars (even lower than PHANTOM MENACE!) I do not plan on seeing The Last Jedi ever again &amp; will not watch Ep. IX if Disney has anything to do with it. They ruined Star Wars for me.',\n",
       " \"The plot is so weak and silly. Unbelievable that this is the plot for big movie.The characters is so stupid. The mighty Snoke died by the most stupid villain in Starwars' history. The legend Luke died pointlessly. If finally he has to die, why he doesn't go fight directly with Kilo? Stupid. Have all the knights been trained? They fight lilke kids who got light saber as x'mas gift! Forget spectacular Jedi fight like in Ep 1-3. Only kids fights you can see. If they want to expand the territory of force other than Jedi power, make a new movie is better.The worst thing of this movie is FORCING TWIST PLOT. It sounds cool at first but it totally failed.

The Last Jedi is full of bad jokes, unexplained phenomenas (like how does Lea, get blown out of a ship and then get\\'s back in, like some sort of Superwoman). Together with some bad story choices: like light speed tracking? Snoke playing \"Jedi mind tricks\" on Rey and Kylo so they are connecting with each other? It feels like this movie missed the point in what makes SW so special. Was it all that bad? No, the ending scene on Crait was interesting, and that is where you will see a little bit of the \"old\" Luke Skywalker back, but that real \"Star Wars\" moment was sadly short lived.

Poe's prank call to Hux, Luke milking a space cow, Snoke admonishing Kylo on his ridiculous mask - play them one after the other and you have a robot chicken montage.2.) the purple haired admiral surpassed Jar Jar Binks as the most annoying and pointless character in the entire saga (no small feat)3.) Princess Lea flying through space? *palm to forehead*4.) Space Vegas: What the hell was the point of Benecio's character? or Finn and Rose's mission? or releasing those horse creatures? ug.5.) Yoda is cool with destroying the last remnants of the Jedi movement he spent hundreds of years defending? Yeah, ok.6.) So much for learning more about Snoke's backstory. What a waste of screen time on a character that had the potential to be interesting. Instead he turns out to be a poorly written, poor man's Palpatine with a half assed character arc.7.) Rey's wooden acting continues to make Hayden Christensen look like an Oscar winner.8.) I really feel bad for Chewbacca. At least Han, Leia, Luke and Admiral Ackbar have been put out of their misery. Poor Chewey has to suffer through another movie.Critics giving this movie positive reviews are just mindless NPC hacks. Rian Johnson &amp; Kathleen Kennedy can whine and call fans misogynists all they want, the fact is they re just not very good at their jobs. They both should be fired and run out of town on a rail for this disaster, but Bob Iger probably gave them big raises.

Remember the high note The Force Awakens ended on when Rey handed Luke his father's light saber? I can't say I like what happened when he took the light saber, but wow were my expectations subverted! So I guess that makes it brilliant?Speaking of subverting expectations, I think there is a lesson to be learned here, and that lesson is thinking twice before handing the reigns of beloved blockbuster franchise like Star Wars over to an indie director. What Johnson has done is attempt to be bold and deconstruct these legendary and beloved characters. And the end result is a split of the fan base.Even though Disney and Lucasfilm have made a lot of money from The Last Jedi, I have to think the fandom will be less than willing to flock to the theaters to see episode IX multiple times. I am very surprised the studios chose to go this route. The script is terribly sloppy and very disrespectful to the original trilogy's characters as well as its fans.

Let\\'s leave out all the sexist nonsense. There are many valid reasons fans felt insulted by this entry into the franchise.Let\\'s go straight to yet another valid point - he went full stupid in so many cases. Intentional? It\\'s just who he is? He solved problems by being a crap writer in multiple cases. And this happens so often in the show, I could write a novel on it. Instead I\\'ll focus on 6 glaring examples within the story.1) Droid smash - was this an attempt at humor? Because he uses the same lack of intellect to solve many issues throughout, so I wouldn\\'t be surprised if having BB-8 head-smash into the sparking circuits to \"fix them\" was the best solution Rian had to offer. Completely lacking intelligence and logic, this is par for the course.2) Blowing up bombers - One blows, they all go because they are flying close together. \"Oh, in real life they fly close together...\". In real life, if they destroyed everyone around them, they wouldn\\'t. They would be smarter. Different consequences require more intelligent planning. Making those pilots and everyone they work for complete morons is the Rian way, it seems.3) Manhole cover- You\\'re making your escape with everyone on your trail and you need to cover your tracks. Are you really going to leave your escape path open? They couldn\\'t find them with tunnel sensors or anything more believable, more intelligent? Nope, because intelligence is not the Rian way.4) Crashing out of love - The supreme sacrifice is about to be made. Someone is going to stop the weapon that is opening the door to remaining rebels. Then some selfish twit crashes into him at high speed, knowing the writer won\\'t use logic or realism and will instead have them both survive the horrific crash. Yes, it\\'s a bad crash that in real life would have killed them both. Yes, she put her feelings above the lives of her compatriots - the very definition of selfishness. Yes, it was a nice sentiment, but very poorly executed on many levels. Again, the Rian way.5) Management - when Rian goes dumb, he goes dumb on every level he can think of. Drama is one thing, but having the commanders keep everyone in the dark and inviting a mutiny isn\\'t just the worst kind of leaderhip...it\\'s also the Rian way. He couldn\\'t think of any more intelligent way to keep suspense but have intelligent, competent leaders? Or does he just hate women and this was his way of calling women in leadership fools?6) Rian doesn\\'t comprehend explosions. Explosions burn, they have shrapnel, they kill. In fake Hollywood shows like Mission Impossible they throw people and have no shrapnel or heat, but can\\'t we have something better here? Leia was only knocked out...and only for a few seconds or she would have suffocated... It\\'s one thing to have Stormtroopers unable to hit a target, but now explosions randomly completely miss as well? It\\'s one thing if something shielded her from the blast, but no, instead we get more from Rian.And the mental midget didn\\'t just do this with the story, he did it with fan expectations as well. He chooses to give the fan theories no satisfaction, to alienate the fans, to handle fan expectations in the dumbest way possible - but just making everything nothing. No specialness to the main character\\'s parents. No backstory or awesomeness from Supreme Leader Snoke and so on.He gave us his best and it was awful dribble.

Except for a few moments of good cinematography and evocative scenes, I can see no merit in this film at all.From a dysfunctional script, to weak performances (save one or two who shone on their own, despite the movie, like Oscar Isaac), to incoherent editing and scenes arbitrarily strung together, to amateurishly conceived characters and creatures, inept and inconsistent story telling, and generally uninspired film making, the film was a constant messy failure.And what was the bizarre island milking scene?!

I worried about a lot of things, and every worry I had was fulfilled in full, glorious technicolor from Perfect Rey to Sulkey Luke.Why didn\\'t Purple Hair Admiral tell Poe her plan, even after he stormed the room and demanded answers? The crew deserved to know the plan at that point, like Poe said, but she dug in her heels and for some reason didn\\'t tell him. And then reasonably Poe issued a mutiny, an act that could have been completely avoided if Purple Hair would have swallowed her pride and told everyone the plan.Snoke is one of the most confusing things to happen in the entire Star Wars era. He appears suddenly in The Force Awakens, and dies just as suddenly in the next movie. Any potential he had was wasted.One of the worst flaws of the movie - the character of Luke was destroyed mercilessly. He had a terrible experience and then moped for years on an island, an island he claimed he wanted no one to find but for some reason he gave R2D2 a map, so, what\\'s up with that... And worse, he didn\\'t seem to show any remorse that he ran away and pouted on an island for years while the Resistance suffered. And then he died, but don\\'t worry, it was with \"peace and purpose\" and all that mumbo jumbo so we don\\'t have to feel badly about it. I am so done.The Force was butchered in the movie. The whole live-Skype thing going on with Rey and Kylo was kind of odd, especially when finding out Snoke instigated it. Of course then you have the water on Kylo\\'s glove, which is kind of weird, but not as weird as Yoda calling lightning down from the sky and then cackling like a lunatic. I literally thought it was a dream sequence, or maybe Kylo was appearing as Yoda. Both the lightning and the laugh deserved to be scribbled over with a red pen.The entire bridge of a ship was destroyed and everyone died - except for Princess Leia, of course, who Mary Poppinsed her way back to the ship, floating around in space, and was somehow able to open her eyes without them immediately freezing over. Fans will insist it was because she was \"strong with the Force\", but this is, again, a discrepancy with the whole Force thing - the Force is not life support. It doesn\\'t make you immortal and it doesn\\'t make you fly. The whole clip was weird and very cringey.Rey has one three-minute Jedi training session that makes her as skilled as a fully-trained Jedi master.There is so much violence and unnecessary killing in this movie you\\'ll feel like taking a shower after the credits come on.The movie feels like ten hours long, or maybe twelve, because the plot drags like nothing else in the middle. There were a lot of cringe-worthy moments sprinkled throughout, with useless storylines (Rose and Finn) and another long, winding shot around Luke\\'s island.It repeated several things from the original trilogy (like that \"You still have light in you!\" conversation between Rey and Kylo), a fad continued on from The Force Awakens. With their 200M budget, it\\'s hard to think they didn\\'t get any writers who could think of an original idea without it being totally lame.The character of Princess Leia was entirely boring. 90% of her role was sitting around somewhere looking disturbed. She didn\\'t really do anything, and her acting sometimes resembled a cardboard cutout\\'s. Overall incredibly depressed with this movie. It wasn\\'t all bad - Poe was AWESOME, for instance - but there were enough flaws and holes to wonder how all the writers, directors, and producers managed to blow 200M dollars on a mediocre Star Wars movie (mediocre is a generous word for it). Of course they made their money back at the box office, but I wonder how many true fans they disappointed and how many people they sent away saddened by the now deadness of the Star Wars universe.',\n",

Who is Snoke? Do we ever find out who he was other than being the antagonist? No? Anybody out there would care to answer why I would be happy to see a guy chopped in half? The guy is ugly but that hardly merits death. How did Snoke not sense that Kylo was going to use the Force to kill him? He practically brags about how easy it was to \"Jedi\" Kylo\\'s mind, pulling his strings like he was a puppet. The character is so obviously created by CGI that he might as well have been a cartoon. Snoke is only evil for the sake of being evil and when he dies I really don\\'t feel like that the \"Force\" is relieved.And then there is the scene where Luke milks the teats of that bizarre looking alien. I mean seriously??? Why were we subjected to that scene? We move from Luke cutting off limbs from aliens to milking them? Was that creature even sentient? Because the smile of satisfaction that it gets is disturbing to say the least. However, that scene with Mark Hamill aptly symbolizes what the producers are doing to this franchise. What I can\\'t understand is if the Jedi are over or not? When Luke meets Kylo Ren in \"astro projection\" mode (this is a new Jedi power, but who cares) and tells him that the Jedi will not end with him and that there\\'s another... The scene cuts over to Rey. But earlier Luke tells Yoda that the Jedi are over... So which is it? Was he just messing with Kylo? Is Luke just trying to hurt his nephew?Kylo Ren is a monster, then he isn\\'t, then he is, then he isn\\'t... Oh how confusing! He looks like a comic book villain. Then he has a moment which seems to imply that he and Rey are going to make out. I won\\'t be surprised to discover that Rey is his long lost twin sister. Leia is sucked out into the vacuum of space but she brings herself back onto the ship with the Force of magic (or the magic of the Force)... Man, the Force is really picky about who it wants to save. I really hope that this was the last Star Wars movie ever, because I don\\'t think I could tolerate another bad storytelling.',\n",

       " 'I could spend so much time talking about this movie, but I will try to keep myself contained. But in all honesty, I have never, ever in my whole life been so disappointed by a movie.This movie made me depressed. Basically everything that you loved about the original characters, the force, the Jedi, the continuity and style... it\\'s either gone or altered in a severely stupid way.1) The portrayal of Luke Skywalker in this film is a complete betrayal of his character. A while back (and many times after) Mark Hamill claimed that he fundamentally disagreed with every choice Rian Johnson made for his character. The optimist, iconic hero, and true symbol of good is turned into a grumpy old man who wants to end the Jedi order and die. This is a grumpy old man who would also consider killing his own nephew. What true Star Wars fan wants to see this? It honestly just made me sick that the creators would take this route \\'to be different\\'. This is the same character who wouldn\\'t kill his father, the evil lord Darth Vader, because he believed there was still good in him when literally no one else would. This proves to me two things: Rian Johnson is not a true Star Wars fan and is willing to take risks just for the sake of taking risks, even if they completely destroy the continuity of this beloved franchise. How great to know that even after everything he\\'s been through in the original trilogy, my favorite hero has had a depressing life and spent many years alone on an island, ditching his friends and wanting to die. Only to come back for a lightsaber fight against Kylo Ren which doesn\\'t end up happening. Seriously, this could have been the fight of the ages. It\\'s set up sooooo well before he reveals that he\\'s actually just a projection and he\\'s still on the island... and he dies because too much force I guess. Are you kidding me?!?! That\\'s how LUKE SKYWALKER goes out?!?! Shame on you, Rian. This depiction disrespects Luke Skywalker, Mark Hamill, and every other true fan of Luke and Star Wars.2) The humor in this film is cringey at times and so so out of place for Star Wars. I hate the way comedy is used in films these days. Every meaningful moment is replaced with some cheap and honestly stupid joke. Its an easy way out of comprehensive story-telling for writers where the audience goes \"he he\" and forgets what was even happening. It\\'s the type of humor that breaks the fourth wall and won\\'t be funny in any way the fifth time you watch it. So disappointing to see this lazy Marvel-esque style comedy in Star Wars. 3) The plot is just weird. It\\'s another factor of this movie that just felt lazy--- like it was planned out just to make certain events happen. The problem is nothing makes sense. The whole film is a slow, drawn-out \"chase\" scene between the First Order and one large Resistance ship. I\\'m still confused about how an entire fleet of Star Destroyers led by a 60 kilometer wide dreadnought flagship was able to follow this Resistance ship for seemingly hours upon end and not completely destroy them.4) The Finn-Rose plot is so horribly stupid and frusturating. The two (who by the way have no chemistry at all) are sent on a mission to find a \\'codebreaker\\' who can disable the First Order from tracking them through hyperspace. They arrive on Canto Bight, the casino planet, the mission dies and everything goes downhill from there. Basically Rose lectures Finn, who is initially loving the place, about how the rich take advantage of the needy blah blah blah capitalism is bad. I HATE going to movies and being taught a lesson. And in Star Wars? Go die Disney. The whole time I was watching their story I was basically just thinking about how much a waste of precious Star Wars time it was. But hey, \"it was worth it\" because they got to save the weird space horse creatures. 5) Another disappointing part of this movie is the Rey lineage reveal. In the past Rian Johnson has spoken about how JJ Abrams basically \"set things up\" for him in The Force Awakens and how he really had total control to take the story where he wanted. My instantaneous question to that is WHY?? That seems like a really terrible way to create a fluent story. And it shows... But many people seem to still be okay with it. In fact, some seem to believe that Rian Johnson\\'s decision for Rey to be a nobody fixes many aspects of Star Wars. The new message is that story is no longer focused on the Skywalkers, and anyone can be just as powerful as they were. This is not the Star Wars legacy. Star Wars was never broken and it never needed to be fixed to fit the millennial world view that you don\\'t have to try to succeed. This movie confirmed to me that Disney sadly only cares about the commercial and financial aspects of Star Wars. They are very much aware the cultural impact that this franchise has had on people. This film continues Star Wars for the sake of continuing Star Wars. It\\'s story is designed to \"shake things up\" and continue to bring the \"Star Wars\" name and brand to front and center. But in doing so it throws most of Star Wars out the window. Original characters are changed, built-up ideas are just thrown away, story continuity is messed up... The prequels were better than this because the story felt real, meaningful, like the creator\\'s intent was about how this Star Wars story could logically make sense given what has come before. Everything felt like it still existed in a galaxy far, far away. The prequels were different, genuine, unique, and surprising. They did however, lack in several other areas. But they felt like Star Wars. The Last Jedi did not. I left this movie feeling empty. Sad that a huge part of my life was disgraced.',\n",
       " \"Just before the movie was released, I saw a plethora of overwhelmingly positive critical reviews. I was genuinely excited to see this movie. I thought how can so many reviews get this wrong?I went to the theater with a few friends and got ready to enjoy the film. Unfortunately, that was the end of my anticipation and excitement.The movie was one of the biggest disappointments of any previous film I've seen. The film was dragged out, riddled with plot holes and ridiculous moments. It's filled with SJW political innuendos, and deflates the build up of Luke Skywalker's return with it's bad storytelling.1) Poe/ Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo sub plot is ridiculous. Instead of explaining her idiotic plan from the beginning she lets Poe run around like a fool, the people on the ship fear for their lives, and goes so far as to allow Poe to enact an almost successful mutiny, just so Holdo can dismissed Poe and make him look inferior to the her. On top of that, Holdo's 'grand' plan to hide on a planet is a failure as they end up bottle-necked and likely massacred if it wasn't for Luke Skywalker. 2) Leia flying through space--Instead of poignantly killing her--they keep her alive in a laugh out loud moment where she flies hovers through the vacuum of space.3) The whole 'Capitalism is Bad' planet that ultimately was not needed. 4) Luke Skywalker's failure to see the good in Kylo. While it's interesting to see a Luke that has been weathered down by failure--its predictable (Obi-Won) and was done in a bad way. You don't see much of the brilliance and mystique a Jedi once represented. Instead, you see an incredibly bitter old man that would rather let his family and friends die over his 'I hate everything' attitude. Furthermore, it goes against the entire build up of the previous trilogies and against his character. Luke was meant to be the chosen one--he was meant to overcome the dark side and restore order to the galaxy. 5) Rey's big reveal is....just bad. Yes, Anakin was a slave, Luke grew up a 'nobody'--but to emphasis that point without any further development to why that is the case is more bad writing. 6) Snoke's anti-climactic ending. While him dying midway in is a change of predictability--it is done in such a poor fashion. Firstly, he should not have died so easily given his previous show of ability. Secondly, they offered NO character development as to why he was doing the things he did. Anyway, I could go on and on about the various points within the film that are a failure--but I won't.In summation, this is a bad movie, bolstered by inaccurately suspicious critical r and non-critical seemingly botted reviews that favor pushing a particular political agenda despite weak writing and shoddy character development.\",\n",

The cute parts were ludicrous. The plot made no sense, it was full of meaningless actions and meaningless reversals. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen it is so badly written that I can't believe people okayed this script. The first movie was far from perfect but at least it has some unique action stuff and some flow it was actually a decent effort at making a Star Wars movie. Sure they copied stuff but at least it has some kick to it. This is lifeless nonsense. Example of the meaningless actions and reversals.

A movie website today posted a survey done by a private social media firm that said: \"All the negative audience reactions are fake - the fans really love this movie.\"Are you kidding me?How did that PRIVATE firm do that research?How do they validate this?And this movie was just an abomination for us genuine fans. Yes, us fans who know the saga inside and out. I see comments from young fans saying \"I didnt know what to feel when I saw the movie the first time, but after I saw it a second time, it was better.\"REALLY?You mean that was the audience reaction back in 1997 when we went in to see Star Wars A new hope, and we all came out full of energy, full of passion, wanting to be a wookie and a smuggler and oh, to wield a lightsaber (NOT a lasersword).The whole world got spaceoperavirus and fell in love.You mean they should have said \"WARNING - to fully appreciate this film it takes mutiple viewings\".Then came Empire Strikes Back - did that movie have a text on the poster saying \"WARNING - to fully appreciate this film it takes mutiple viewings\".Remember all you who call us true fans who have a deep love and understanding of the original saga, of what George Lucas created and of his template for what defines a Star Wars movie - now you young folks cal us \"fanatics\", \"oldtimers\", \"fanboys\", \"right-wing\" - but remember:The ONLY reason you have your Lats Jedi is because of US, because the love we felt for a true creative effort and mind entertaining us to the degree that we fell in love with the saga, with the heroes, with the villains.Thats why the saga has lived on, because of the original fans who was there when the magic happend. Our love has fueld this saga and is the only reason for the largest moviemachine on this planet to now start churning out movie after movie after movie...This movie is not Star Wars.Its not passion.Its not saga.Its not giving the fans the credit we deserve by honoring OUR LOVE that actually has kept this saga alive.For me - it all ended on Endor that heroic night.What we have today is just soulless filmmakers for hire trying to get people to make Disneys corporate bosses get a bigger salarybonus each year.Sad.

       " \"So far, Disney has only shown that they wish to keep fanboys happy rather than further expand the Star Wars Universe. Personally, I enjoyed the prequels. I did not have the same aversion as all the fanboys. Perhaps it is because of my generation, but it was quite evident (for me, at least) to see the story of Anakin and his final redemption as the key story of Star Wars. The prequels expanded the universe and added some answers, whilst also leaving behind some mystery (if albeit having some poor dialogue and CGI).Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are completely cheesy, cliched and exist in E.7/E.8 purely for the fanboys outrage over the prequels supposed 'breaking of tradition'. Well, I personally do not care for your love of individual characters romanticised over years. I am interested in seeing Star Wars as a tapestry of primordial mythology expressed in an innovative space opera. To me, this is what Star Wars is about and why it has such an appeal.Don't get me wrong, this movie still contains some elements of the struggle of ones recognition of Self. But any philosopher/mythologist/esotericist could easily point out the large flaws in this movie. If we ignore the mythological side of the movie and focus upon the more objective elements, you are left with very cheesy dialogue and overuse of attempted humour leaving you to cringe throughout.What was good? The sets and costumes are just beautiful! The contrasting colours make for a highly enjoyable visual feast (however, the Yoda CGI and dialogue was incredibly poor. Think of the cheesiness of the original trilogy Yoda x 10!). There are some 'new' elements being teased for further exploration (ie. Kyber Crystals).It feels like I may be the only person in the world who thinks so, but I really wish I could see what George Lucas had planned for these movies as I am sure he would have maintained a balance between the Star Wars Universe and a mystical space opera.\",\n",

The plot is driven entirely by calamitous or serendipitous coincidences--there is literally no point to almost anything that happens in this movie.

For example: Rey's parents were insignificant alcoholics, Luke had drunk green milk from a weird cow, and Snoke ... well ... he's dead now.What really bothered me about the movie was its jokes.

It was so bad that it took a while (several days) to process how bad and viscerally offensive this movie was.

It injected political opinions that have no business in a Star Wars movie and added a bunch of scenes that don't tie particularly well with the rest of the movie. It took Luke Skywalker, a character teased throughout Episode VII, and fundamentally changed who he was before killing him.Though the audience is clearly with me on this one, I find it sad that the critics on Rotten Tomatoes don't seem to know any better. The entire movie was poorly written, disregards the prior seven films in the series, and intentionally disappoints its fans.Putting it bluntly, I know nothing about the next film but I'm already not going to watch Episode IX.

Since while she was taking her nap they barely moved. Thats just one of the many extremely obvious plot holes. A huge unnecessary sub plot takes place because Holdo withholds vital information from basically everyone. Sending Finn and some throw away character on a ridiculous sub plot to nowhere. They meet up with a guy that helps them get into Joke's... oops I mean Snoke's ship and then the guy turns them in and apparently relays Holdo's plan to Hux who quickly makes use of the information targeting the transports. Second question; How did the code breaker guy know the plan since Finn, etc didn't know it... only Holdo knew it at this point, oh maybe Leia did but she was napping in a white bag.

And a good waste of money.The Last Jedi deserves every ounce of critique it has garnered over the last months.It tries to be stylish and smart, elevating theme over story, which might work in an Indie movie, but in Star Wars rings hollow and pretentious. Especially when it\\'s poorly executed.Rian Johnson basically threw the baby out with the bathwater when decided not to continue with JJ Abrams\\'s take. As a result the continuity errors and tonal differences are too big to ignore. Was Abrams movie hopeful, Johnsons take is nihilistic not even sparing Luke Skywalker\\'s character, making his \"hero\\'s journey\" all for naught. It also invalidates TFA, it\\'s McGuffin, the last piece of the Map to Luke Skywalker, it\\'s whole raison d\\'être, was to find Luke to train Rey. And now Luke doesn\\'t want to be found and he doesn\\'t want to train Rey -so why leave a map to be found?This is but one of the examples.It lays bare what most of us feared when JJ Abrams was not to helm Episode VIII: There was no creative director to ensure continuity, tone and direction across three movies. RJ came in and flipped everything that JJ set up.It\\'s premise is laughably bad: the slowest chase in film history ever. It picks up right after TFA, which will creates issues with character arcs.It has major plot holes. It cannot keep up with it\\'s own logic. It has pacing issues. Especially the Canto Bight sub plot. The plot is blatantly contrived, there is no natural from x follows y flow, all events that occur, all decisions made by the characters seem to be in service of the plot, even though the decision itself is ludicrous.There is no hero\\'s journey, not for Rey, not for Finn, not for Rose, not for anybody. Rey waves a magic wand and is a Jedi. Making her officially a Mary Sue.There are too many porgs and porg-jokes. The movie tries to be too funny by launching too many jokes at the viewer, as a result the jokes are in general poorly timed, destroying the impact of a serious scene just before.The prank call by Poe in the beginning is funny, but would suit Peter Parker better, for Poe its like he\\'s acting out of character . It also undermines the New Order. Making them seem weak and incompetent.The movie also tries to do things different, but ultimately fails.The character motivations are shallow and don\\'t lead to any character growth.The twists (to do things differently) are more \"gotchas!\", without any real impact.They don\\'t have a resonating pay off like \"Luke, I am your father\" had.And worst of all, it ends like the movie was a two parter.Our intrepid heroes are safe. There is no cliffhanger, no hooks, no lines, no slider that makes you want to go and watch Episode IX. At the end of the day, The New Trilogy isn\\'t doing anything new. They conveniently set the story up, that it\\'s a small rebellion against a big mean bully and TLJ tries to drive this home by decimating the Resistance (apparently that was all it was), because the Millenium Falcon is too small to take everyone on board and fly everyone to safety at the end of the movie..Now there are some positives. The music, the art direction, the visuals, the acting , the action. It\\'s all stunning, Gorgeous, Masterful, but too much Michael Bay to me: style over substance. Smoke and mirrors.I know there are people that loved this movie, and I tried not to summarize all examples I can think of, of continuity mistakes etc, but this movie kept pulling me out of my suspension of disbelief.

What was bad enough though the movie was just too long (or felt too long) and I didn't care about the First Order, the Rebels, nor any of the characters except for Snoke and Poe. The motivations of the characters are unbelievably shallow and exactly that was the reason it didn't get me involved.Also, I hoped to get answers like who is Snoke, how come is he so powerful and also some explanation of the whole conflict, vainly. What I got instead was battle here battle there, the heroes getting out of trouble with incredible luck through convenient coincidences and wannabe dramatic moments.

       " 'It breaks my heart to write this but this movie is truly soulless and all around awful. Absolutely poorly written and conceived. The characters are flat, weak, one-dimensional, and out-of-character. The structure is massively flawed and the plot is riddled with holes.I\\'ve seen every Star Wars movie in theater at least four times on top of countless viewings at home. I will never watch The Last Jedi again. It is hands down the worst in the franchise. I\\'m going to watch Attack of the Clones to cleanse my pallet...The filmmakers main goal across the board was to destroy and manipulate our expectations by breaking rules set in the Star Wars universe and by debunking every possible fan theory based on questions set up in The Force Awakens. If you want to play with audiences expectations do it in a standalone genre movie by playing with its genre conventions, not in an established canon. They pulled this \"Tricked you / surprise card\" so many times it was repulsive. Maybe try using two or three of your brilliant mind blowing disrespectful spins on fan expectations.I\\'ve never had such polarizing different opinions with critics as I do with this movie. I spent countless hours reading fan reviews and watching youtube reviews (positive and negative) and the problems that everyone has are consistent across the board. I\\'m having a hard time understanding why this would be the best critically reviewed Star Wars movie when I feel this is the worst produced... The filmmakers were more concerned with burning the past to build the future that they want. They don\\'t care what the characters or story deserve and are trying to kill the Star Wars mythology.The original trilogy\\'s themes were hope, faith, loyalty, family and redemption. The Last Jedi dismantles that and it\\'s theme is \"Let the past die, kill it if you have to.\" and to disrespect everything that made Star Wars a universally beloved saga. Star Wars was about the eternal fight of light versus dark and finding the balance between the two. The Last Jedi is grey, bleak, and full of politically correct social propaganda being shoved down your throat in every other scene. Honestly this movie is subversive, divisive, and extremely hypocritical. Entertainment should be entertainment, don\\'t politicize our escape that actually bonds everyone no matter their age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or religion.This movie intentionally tries to retroactively destroy everything we loved about the Star Wars movies that came before it.',\n",
       " 'From the little details to the plot as a whole this movie was bad. My biggest complaints involve Luke, Snoke, and the Finn side-plot. The first we see of Luke he takes the lightsaber from Rey (the anticipation of which was the only thing that made me come back to watch the next Star Wars movie) and throw it over his shoulder. This is such a huge turn away from the character we knew and an insult to the fans who eagerly anticipated the conclusion of that cliffhanger. We later see that Luke attempted to murder his nephew as a child. Not a believable thing for the character of Luke to do.. He is the guy who wouldn\\'t kill his father even when Obi-Wan and Yoda wanted him too! Next is Snoke. This character made no sense in The Force Awakens, but I was willing to hear an explanation of him in this film. There was none. He died in a pretty cool scene, but now we are left with an inexplicable overpowered Emperor Palpatine knockoff who doesn\\'t fit into the existing Star Wars universe at all. Finn was an unnecessary character in The Force Awakens who was clearly just comic relief and to diversify the cast. In this movie it was worse. The side quest his character and Rose (random frumpy chick) go on was utterly pointless and not even entertaining. It also included the most explicit political commentary in Star Wars to date, which is ridiculous and does not bode well for the franchise. (Yes, Star Wars has always had political themes and politics has been involved in the plot, but it has been very abstract and fictitious in a simple good versus evil way.) And when Finn was about to sacrifice himself and we were all cheering because we thought that was the end of his character, he is suddenly stoped from sacrificing himself by someone else\\'s (potential) self-sacrifice. That is such nonsense. Now for the less important criticisms.. The movie begins with a fairly comical scene involving Poe, which went too far and just became awkward in my opinion. Later in the scene bombs fell out of a ship in outer space.. I know it is sci-fi, but come on, we all know there is no gravity in space. That is one of the defining characteristics. The \"code cracker\" character was ridiculous. The stutter was so idiotic and he just happened to be taking a nap in their prison cell, what? The anti-climactic end of admiral Ackbar was a disgrace. Not to mention the silly admiral who replaced him and caused the whole pointless Finn side quest. The way Leia saved herself from death in outer space was silly, and pointless because the actual actress is no longer alive to act in Episode 9. I\\'m done listing things actually, I have too many more things to say. But generally this movie is bad for Star Wars as a franchise and though I have been a huge fan my whole life I probably will not go to see episode 9.',\n",
       " 'The opening lines of the movie, delivered by General Hux, truly felt like a parody and I genuinely wondered if it was some kind of pre-movie joke. Unfortunately, it wasn\\'t, the real movie had indeed started and felt like a joke throughout. So, critics were raving about the humour in this movie. And indeed, the original Star Wars movies had humour in them. But those funny moments were delivered by only a few characters (like Han Solo or Chewie) and a handful of situational moments like the Cantina. In this movie, it\\'s a constant. They even tried to give a funny moment to Kylo Ren at the end of the movie (when Hux was repeating his orders like a moronic parrot)... Really? He\\'s the super villain of the galaxy, not a comical relief! If Darth Vader had been delivering jokes, would he be the epitome of the bad guy? No! To have credible story and credible bad guys, you need to lay off the jokes and create believable and fearsome characters.Anyway, I disliked the fact that every scene and every situation had slapstick comedy, but maybe that\\'s just me.On a more objective note, there are things that cannot be forgiven.Luke Skywalker, for instance, has become an hermit and spend his days fishing and generally doing nothing on a remote island off the irish coast, inhabited only by weird looking nuns and ugly fat sea-anteaters he milks on a daily basis. He doesn\\'t care one bit about the fact that his sister and the Resistance are being slaughtered by the First Order, he\\'s just moping around because he failed his apprentice, Kylo Ren. And why did he fail him? Because he saw darkness in him and gave up all hope to train him as a jedi. When did Luke Skywalker become such a quitter? Did he give up on Vader, who was the baddest baddie ever? No, he saw a bit of light in him and did all he could to turn him! Then he gives Rey a half-hearted lesson in Jedi things and quits teaching her right after. And finally, he does his ultimate force projection at the end, vanish into thin air, and leaves us wondering how did the mythical hero of the Star Wars universe become such an uninteresting wimp.So, that\\'s one character ruined.Let\\'s not talk about Leia who can force-fly through space, Mary Poppins-like, I\\'ll just pretend this never happened.The rest of the movie is just a succession of bad plots and bad ideas, and I\\'ll just list a few here:* Space bombers that are designed to drop bombs. In space. Where there\\'s no gravity.* Purple haired admiral who waits until the penultimate ship of the Resistance is destroyed (luckily, the only that\\'s left intact is the one with General Organa and the heroic pilots in it) before finally moving her big ship and destroying the First Order dreadnought. * Purple haired admiral who decides not to tell her plans to her companions because hey, why share that when you can pass for a traitor and freak out your entire crew, leading them to mutiny? By the way, that\\'s not how a plot twist works at all.* The big bad guy Snoke killed by a cheap trick you can see coming miles away, without his background, story or character developed one bit. Two seconds to kill him and then 20 minutes of fighting his guards in the most meaningless lightsaber fight ever. I still don\\'t even know why the guards were fighting. To protect Snoke\\'s dead body?* The Resistance, hidden behind a big metal door gets trapped because the First Order arrives at said door and \"it\\'s the only way out\". Nobody thought about checking the back of the cave even though the sparkling foxes found a rear exit without any problem.* The Finn and Rose adventure in Space Vegas, absolutely unnecessary and stupid side plot, especially because they had access to communication devices and could have called anyone to help them after they talked to Maz Kanata. Why not call that super-duper code breaker guy instead of wasting fuel and time in this nonsense adventure? Just for the sake of having them ride space race-goats and then being betrayed by Benicio del Toro and not save the day at all. But anyway, there wasn\\'t any day to be saved as the rescue plan was going as planned and no purple-haired admiral was trying to ruin the Resistance.Anyway, I could go on and on about all the things that weren\\'t right in this movie, but the bottom line is: this is not only a bad Star Wars movie, this is simply a bad movie, half written, full of plot holes and bad ideas, negating everything the previous movie tried to build and generally ruining the Star Wars universe.',\n",

On the contrary to the former one, this episode is not a simple manipulation of the plotting of episodes of the oldest trilogy during 1977-1983, and it is pretty sadistic for fans, but also it is full of twists and surprises.  Rey and others are not charismatic beside Luke and Leia. Moreover, Snoke is supposed to be created and modelled from image of actor Ed Harris. Asian-look Rose is something familiar for contemporary audiences. Adding racial diversities to this trilogy.  One of the typical twists in this episode is death of Snoke, and Darth Vador-like Kylo takes initiative of the first order unexpectedly. While Rey and Kylo corroborate to fight against Snoke and its entourage, audiences physiologically hope that Kylo comes to light-side.However, it is only an episodic corporation between them. This episode depicts how failed master/ teacher confront his past failure and his worst student who exceeds his ability. This is the most emotional content of this film. When Luke's shadow confronts full scale of fire from the armed forces of the first order in front of the sealed gate of the last bastion of the republic, the catastrophic moment arrives. Its heroic figure of Luke and Mark Hamill is quite impressive and memorable among all characters of this episode.  I love this episode more than the former one. It is not a simple duplication of plotting of the oldest trilogy. Mark Hamill and his Luke proved that filmmaker just need their iconic work during their entire career. Mark Hamill is experiencing his second peak of his film career since the oldest trilogy of Star Wars (1977-83). It is the remarkable thing in this Disney made newest trilogy. Everybody remembers Luke Skywalker as living legend.\",\n",
       " \"If we look at The Last Jedi detached from our feelings on Star Wars and the characters, we are still left with a bad movie. It is a poorly executed film on all levels. The plot is rushed and jumbled and there were multiple occurrences where the movie felt that it was at its climax, but it kept pushing on. In many ways, I felt like I was watching three or four movies hastily pushed into one. The timeline of the movie is confusing as we have the plot with the Resistance fighters and the First Order occurring in the span of 18 hours, but these scenes are intercut with Rey and Luke's interactions, which clearly take place over several days. When we take into account Rey and Ren's force communications, the timeline does not line up. Rey has much more time in her story than the Resistance fighters do, but the movie tries to make it appear like the events are occurring simultaneously. Moreover, The Last Jedi takes place practically immediately after the events of The Force Awakens, but there is no explanation as to how the First Order regrouped so quickly after the destruction of the Starkiller Base or how Hux, Phasma, and Kylo Ren managed to survive the destruction of the base, as the audience never saw them leave the base in The Force Awakens. While Empire Strikes Back places years in between the events of the preceding movie and itself, The Last Jedi forgoes that and ends up leaving many loose ends left loose. The script is bad. The dialogue is forced and cheesy and feels genuinely out of place from what Star Wars movies have provided in the past. The editing borders on amateur. The special effects are a hot mess from hell. Characters move through the air in ways never shown before in Star Wars and it does not work. It looks cheap, it looks like a parody. The Last Jedi is bad as a movie, not just as a Star Wars movie. As a Star Wars fan, I felt physically ill watching the film. I nearly walked out several times, but stuck around hoping that I would find some small reward for my suffering. I did not. I was pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly in the stomach by this movie as a fan. As a film student, I was shocked by how Disney and Lucasfilm could allow a movie to be so poorly executed.\",\n",

There just wasn't any sense of menace at all in this, Kylo Ren being reduced to more of a side character with moments of telepathy. All this leaves an emotionless hole for 2 and a half hours full of countdowns to being obliterated by yet another powerful weapon while the good guys hastily cobble a plan together to escape again (usually involving one small ship evading all the bad guys.

Because JJ was able to bring back the magic, that I\\'m watching a true Star Wars movie, in every single detail......but, I\\'ve expected much more from the Last Jedi. Another big hit, just like the Empire Strikes back. It was slow, lack of action, with some long boring threads.

We still don\\'t know anything about, his story, or how he influenced Ben Solo to join him etc... However that duel, with the pretorian guards was great, but that whole feeling before, felt like a remake of Episode VI.

I feel he did star wars right, he seemed to care and it ended up being a Star Wars movie. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!Everything I mentioned above can not be said about The Last Jedi or Rian Johnson. It absolutely pains me to say that. He literally put more effort into killing everything we love about star wars and everything that was great about TFA then he did killing off everyone that died in this movie. It\\'s insanely obvious that his goal was to crap on everything JJ did with TFA. The deep maybe almost creepy obsession with Darth Vader, scrapped. The mystery behind Luke\\'s lightsaber calling to Rey, scrapped. He literally ruined that cliff hanger at the end of TFA and the mystery I just spoke of by having Luke toss the lightsaber behind his back like it was his way of saying \"JJ, see what I thought about that\". I see why it was smart to avoid R2D2, C-3PO, and Luke in TFA. But in TLJ Rian avoids the droids like they were aids with cancer, did the same with Chewbacca. I just don\\'t get that.

Phasma, I thought we got her to make up for Boba Fett, nope, killed off by a janitor who just got out of coma. Knights of Ren, nope. Princess Leia has a Star Lord moment then quickly turns into superman instead of a little rewriting and letting that be her death. Luke also had his own superman moment and then a matrix moment. BB8, I love that droid, but BB8 to the rescue every 20 minutes??? Luke\\'s death had basically no meaning out emotion to it.

Honestly I'm the only Star wars fan among all my friends and I've been waiting for 2 years for this movie. SPOLER ALERT!!Lets get to the point, it was kinda.... NO! Really awful!! The script is soo poorly written. Atleast there was one pretty light saber fight in every star wars movie The franchise is famous for its one and only LIGHT SABER fights and sadly there was no action with light saber except some childs play. After force awakens, I bet everyone wondered who supreme leader Snooke might be? sadly we will never know about it hereafter since he was cut in half just like a birthday cake. and who invented the idea of the slowest chase in any galaxy unti the fuel empties? The first order must had many hi tech weapons but we just a canon shooting slowly throughout the movie. And Leia flying in space while surviving the blast? COME ON!! thats ridiculous. All the hype for Luke in force awakens is just to see a teaching session and hologram stand off? The bad ass looking Knights of snooke were pathetic. Rey disappearing just like that from her confrontation with Ren who was equally matched and suddenly shows up with the falcon! Finally Luke's gone... Leia's gone.... Han solo's gone.... The only remaining lineage of skywalker is a weak short tempered Kylo Ren. The only person who disappointed me is myself due to my very high expectation.Terribly disappointed. Its not a Star wars movie. The 4 rating is just for the actors who performed excellent. It's the poor script that killed Star wars.\",\n",

It was super slow and boring in places yet the next moment it would jump in the plot - one minute escaping in transports then suddenly all set up in Crait waiting for the Hoth-like attack.And can anyone explain to me why at the end they're all on the Millennium Falcon happily chatting as if they're at a cocktail party when the Resistance and all their friends have died - I mean the resistance now basically fits on the Millennium Falcon !!!??? They act like they won....And lightspeed jumping can destroy a huge starship? Why not make missiles light jump then and destroy all starships with shields?And the lock breaker - so when exactly was his betrayal planned - why would anyone go to such trouble to catch Finn? Was it planned in advance (how did they know?) - did he turn and betray them later? Why and how? What was the gain from the Imperial side - simply to catch Finn? They're blowing Rebel transports up like there's no tomorrow - why the effort to catch Finn?The big fight scene with the red Snoke bodyguards - I felt like I was watching a modern interpretative dance scene on a stage.Wow - this movie had me shaking my head sooooo often. Where was the heart - the emotional connection - the only time I felt anything was in the reunion scenes - Luke meeting R2 - Luke meeting Chewie - Luke meeting Leia And those emotional highs were paid for by the good writing in previous films and cashed in by a sub-par movie with sub-par writing.

This trilogy was supposed to be link between \"old\" SW and Disney\\'s SW. Was supposed to pass the ball to new characters while having the whole \"old\" crew available for that. Sadly it was done in such hectic and chaotic way. Such transition requires patience, has to be done carefully, but Disney rushed into this, without proper respect given to Luke, Leia and Han. Denying \"old crew\" this one last adventure before introducing young blood is what killed SW for me. What will happen to Rey, Kylo, Finn and Hux in EP9? Will EP9 be any good? The tricky part is that I simply don\\'t care anymore as I feel no connection to any of those new characters.

I have seen every Star Wars film at cinema, escapism at its best, funny entertaining and even with the prequels, a sense of hope and doing better as you left. This film made me want to board a plane find the director and take in front of disney and display him as a traitor to all those who had held Star Wars in high esteme. We have scientists, physists, astrologists, astronauts, engineers, leaders, inspired by the story telling in the Arthurian Star Wars, the last installment just wiped it out and rained it out from on high all over these people, it was not fair and how they got this past as a Star Wars film beggers belief. I have to say Rogue One was an outside bet, but turn out, in my opinion, to be one of the best stories from Star Wars, I will not support anymore Star Wars films after this one, family and friends feel the same.

       " 'I was not a big fan of The Force Awakens when it came out, I like to support underdogs whether its in sports or entertainment and Rey\\'s character was just too damn good at everything for me to support her. Apart from her character\\'s lack of depth/challenges and the obvious script parallels with A New Hope, The Force Awakens wasn\\'t a terrible movie to me. It was nicely paced, had some good action, lightsabers touched and it set up a bit of intrigue for The Last Jedi by leaving a few compelling questions up in the air (who are the knights of Ren, who is Snoke, how is Reys\\'s character going to develop/is she actually going to face some challenges, what is Luke up to/how is he aligned etc). I hated The Last Jedi, there was about a 1.5 hour period in the middle of the movie where I had a headache from all the dumb decisions characters were making, all the stupid jokes that were being forced, the complete waste of time that was Finn\\'s trip to the Casino planet and the absolute lack of any bloody action. I can\\'t understand how people think this is an excellent (7-10 star) movie, the scripting sucks, the acting is very patchy, the narrative sucks, there is hardly any action, some characters suck and get way too much screentime (Finn\\'s girlfriend, purple-haired idiot woman) while other characters get killed offscreen (Ackbar) or just aren\\'t focused on enough (Phasma? worst storm trooper ever? gets death planet blown up and then dies like a wimp?)I really liked following Kylo\\'s internal conflict and am still somewhat interested in his character. After the first movie I felt that Kylo had been basically made to look like a scrub and was probably the least badass lightsaber wielding antagonist Star Wars had seen. Adam Driver stole the show with his acting in the Last Jedi and I really wished the movie had followed him more and at least a mini-boss, mid-movie battle with Rey or atleast someone. By the time Rey and Kylo fight the Praetorian (Red Guard guys?) Guards, I was so jaded from having watched the rest of the movie that I didn\\'t enjoy the scene as much as I should have.I believe it was Red Letter Media (Half in the Bag review show on YouTube) that expressed the theory that the director for the Last Jedi took note of the fact that everyone thought The Force Awakens was a safe almost carbon copy of A New Hope (narrative wise) and then decided to make The Last Jedi something completely different that no one expected. The problem is he failed spectacularly at doing this, making the most boring Star Wars movie in existence, with characters/factions doing the stupidest things (First Order cant see small ships, First Order cant detect a hyper drive warp/know that it will destroy their entire fleet, purple hair not sharing her plans, labelling Finn and Poe as heroes when their exploits got hundreds/thousands killed) as well as other bizarre and almost insulting narrative points such as revealing nothing about Snoke (and then killing him off?), killing Ackbar offscreen when he could have easily replaced the role of the purple hair lady and honestly having Luke go out the way he did at the end of the movie. Both Factions, The First Order and the \"Resistance,\" and their leaders are made to look like absolute idiots in this movie. Its like the benny hill show theme song should have come on at points - Resistance - I will not share my plan and instead fly slowly away until we are almost completely wiped out - First Order - Hold back all our fighters, while our cannons do nothing to their shields lets just fly slowly behind the resistance ships and shoot them for shots and giggles. The Last Jedi ALMOST feels like the final movie in the trilogy (or series or whatever), except for the fact that Rey hasn\\'t really experienced any growth as a character (can lift rocks now and can talk to Kylo through her head?), the major antagonists are still alive, Leia is still alive (her actress is dead however - how did they screw this up!) and there are a handful of people left in the \"Resistance.\" What happens now? Are they gonna grow a bunch of cannon-fodder resistance soldiers in a big hydroponics operation? What possible resources do they have to do anything against the First Order? At the same time, both General Hux and Kylo seem too incompetent to lead the entire First Order by themselves, is the next movie just going to be another episode of whose leadership are the bigger morons?One of the worst things about this movie for me, was at some points (Casino planet springs to mind) it didn\\'t even feel like a Star Wars movie, it felt like some B-Grade average sci-fi blockbuster with all the weird/cringe humor and cutesy stuff going on. To be honest though, while the prequels werent exemplary examples of film-making - they were special and definitely Star Wars. They always had a decent amount of lightsaber action, some big battles, great antagonists, a bit of (weakly executed) political intrigue, established a universe (returned to Coruscant, Tatooine, Naboo etc multiple times) and had some interesting stuff thrown in (Podracers!) LIGHTSABERS DONT EVEN TOUCH IN THIS MOVIE. The ground assault scene on the salt planet was preposterous as well - why did the girl stop Finn from potentially destroying the bunker buster gun (she didnt know ghost luke was going to turn up and distract the bumbling First Order)? How did Finn drag her body all the back to the base so fast, they sped across there for ages in those speeder things? Of course, as I said above, the casino planet arc made me want to leave the cinema.Absolute mess of a review, apologies, I don\\'t write many, but I believed it was necessary to help balance the \"Force\" in regards to the reviews this movie is receiving. I am really not remotely interested in what the next movie has in store, I was angry with how bad this movie was but I think I was more so just disappointed. I love Star Wars and think that you could make some awesome movies with todays technology, quality of narrative production (TV shows have almost become a better source of stories/acting than movies now) and acceptance of somewhat dark themes + violence. The Last Jedi reflects none of these things, it\\'s almost 3 hours of poorly written/acted boring drama, with characters/factions making idiotic decisions and almost no Star Wars action.1 Star is generous from me.Spoilers! Worst Star Wars Movie - The worst movie I went to the cinema for this year - Huge Disappointment',\n",
       " \"This movie was terrible. There was no advancement in the story line of Star Wars. The characters are all inconsequential, even in death. The women in this movie are all superhero amazing, and the men are bumbling idiots. Take that as you will. There is a new twist on the cantina scene, but I found it mind-numbingly asinine. The movie lacks continuity, and plot lines that are introduced go ... no where. On the plus side, I saw some (two) cool things with an X-Wing, but then a really dumb one for comedic purposes. However, I also saw a spacecraft use gravity bombs. Yes, gravity. ... In space. There is more ridiculousness that happens in space, but I won't spoil it. But, it was truly a jaw-dropping, WTF moment in cinema. It made me wonder if the people who wrote this script had ever seen a Star Wars movie before. The only possible way it could've been worse was if the Klingons had shown up, or if their warp drive needed more dilithium crystals or something. I saw Star Wars in the theater 40 years ago. I do not intend to see Episode IX, even on cable. I no longer care what happens in this story. Disney has ruined it.\",\n",

       " \"WARNING SPOILERS!!!!If this were any other movie it would be a mediocre movie as a star wars movie this awful it has effectively killed off the whole storyline one movie too early. The script from the start was weak as was the plot. The characters kept saying weird things out of character for a star wars movie they seemed to like the word spark a lot. It looked like a star wars movie, it sounded like a star wars movie it was actually pretty lame and I will join the many legion of fans that have been gutted by this and the force rebooted. We waited 40 years to find out what happened with the Skywalker saga only to be spoon fed this load of tosh.They tried to patch up holes in the first movie with one liners, you were upset Kylo how did you let a girl with no light sabre training beat you in the last movie blah blah and throw in comedy one liners all over the place and cute little critters to merchandise no doubt.The script is so bad and the story so off the mark that you can't help thinking that whoever wrote it has a) never watched star wars b) doesn't know the story of star wars and c) is an idiotDo Disney even know that there's another movie left they've killed everyone off. Snoke the big bad get's cut in two by Kylo with hardly a thought and the rebels sorry resistance (to me they will ALWAYS be the rebel alliance but not to Disney) are down to their last 12 men. Pity Po has survived he's a very very lame ass character they have jammed him in at the expense of Fin and Reys story they should of stuck to their guns and killed him off in the first movie, but no of all the idiot,s pointless lame characters to make it through Po's still there. Luke doesn't teach Rey anything other than the big hole is evil she goes in anyway and then Luke vanishes like Mark Hamill with a huge pay check off to the Bahamas. Disney has turned this into a weak poorly written load of junk just like the game Batttle Front 2 they've just put out.IMO if you're new to this franchise watch Rogue one then episodes 4 5 and 6 and tbh maybe even episode 1 and then skip the rest.That's me done with star wars no more games or movies gg Disney a 40 yeah fan who doesn't want to watch anymore of your train wrecks.\",\n",

I tried see things in a different light so that I could find some enjoyment and hope for the future of the franchise, but it\\'s oh so hard. Let me start by saying that so many of the plot points in this movie were completely useless and wasted. The entire plot-line of Finn and Rose was utterly pointless. Everything they set out to do ended up having no effect whatsoever, and in fact, they ended up making things worse for the Resistance in the end. It was a mess of unnecessary CGI and bad acting to do what exactly? Explore a part of the universe for 25+ minutes to never be talked about again? Or was it to kill off a character that once again provides no substance to the film? They could have cut that entire sequence out and the film would have very likely ended the same. On top of that, we were given the slowest chase sequence in a Star Wars film, that could have ended with some simple hyperspace maneuvering. In addition, the entire interaction with Admiral Holdo and Poe could have gone in such a more interesting direction, but instead, they throw out the whole traitor route, in favor of a simple lack of communication? Hell, they went as far as mutiny for absolutely no reason. And don\\'t even get me started on Snoke. So much wasted potential. Finishing it off, we have one of the worst send-offs in the Star Wars universe for its potentially greatest character. Did I want something different? Sure, but I don\\'t believe a bad plot counts as \"shaking things up.\"',\n",

       " \"While The Force Awakens wasn't perfect, I still thought it was pretty good. I also loved Rogue One, to the point I saw it 5 times in the box office. The Last Jedi though? I don't plan to see it again. What happened to the serious aspects that JJ Abrahams gave us? The serious movie that Rogue One gave us. Why did TLJ revert back to George Lucas-style campy humor???? FFS, this movie was just a step away from giving us Ewoks and/or Jar Jar comedic effects. The initial space battle scene was great, I think. The special effects there were magnificent. But by the time they got to the casino, I was really starting to not care anymore about whether or not they made it. And then there's Luke and Rey. Again, weird forced comedy. Oh, and could we not have had some explanation as to who in the hell Snoke was? How did he become supreme commander? Ugh. I'm just hugely disappointed on so many levels. As a fan of Star Wars my entire life, this movie is just soul crushing.\",\n",
       " 'Like most people who enjoy Star Wars, I grew up with it. I watched it every time I found it on TV as a kid. I purchased The Trilogy about three times in various formats and iterations. Then, the Prequel Trilogy (The Poop Trilogy, as I tend to refer to it) comes along and ruins all of hope of seeing a good Star Wars movie again.The Force Awakens is released two years ago and my hope is restored. It\\'s not the same, but it doesn\\'t need to be. It has the spirit that I want. There was love in that movie. And Rogue One was great in ways that I hadn\\'t expected. It was also different, but made it clear from the beginning what its intentions were.So the roller-coaster ride of Star Wars fandom brought me to The Last Jedi with pretty high hopes. My friends and I were all pumped up and cheering as The Crawl began, like everyone else. By the end of the movie, the customary applause did not occur. The theater was silent, and I realized that a contorted expression of disgust that remained since about half-way through.I apologize, as if you\\'ve read one negative review of this movie, it seems that you have read most of them. While a lot of people did like it (and I can see why), everyone that disliked it seemed to very similar reasons:*Bad writing and awkward jokes that felt like they belonged in a different movie.*Nearly every lesson learned about goofy CG characters was forgotten. The last half of the movie felt like it was devoted solely to cramming in as many shots of cuddle critters as they could.*Everything except Rey\\'s storyline is completely pointless. There\\'s a mutiny on-board the Resistance cruiser that is so irrelevant (and far too much of the movie) that I\\'m not even going to get into it. Though I will mention that Laura Dern sticks out like a lavender-haired thumb in this movie. The section with Finn and Rose, like the mutiny that is occurring simultaneously, could have been removed from the movie and basically nothing would have changed, other than the run-time being drastically shorter. This convoluted bit of filler involves light speed tracking devices, codebreakers, encrypted shields, a casino on a planet of war-profiteers, and Benecio Del Toro. Throw in a little action sequence for Capt. Phasma before \"killing\" her again, and the storyline ends in basically the same place as it started. The tracker is not disabled, DJ (Del Toro) betrays them for money, a bunch of faceless characters die, and that\\'s about it. But we got more cuddly CG merchandising out of it!*The \"Don\\'t Spoil This\" gimmick that they attached to the TV spots was for good reason. Remember all of those enticing mysteries set up during Ep. VII? Who is Supreme Leader Snoke? Who are Rey\\'s parent\\'s? What really happened with Ben Solo and Luke? You will be extremely disappointed to find out that Rian Johnson did not care to answer those questions. Not to save the revelations for Ep. IX, he just threw them away and moved on with more shots of CGI toy advertisements. Who is Snoke? Who cares... he\\'s dead. Who were Rey\\'s parents? Nobody. They were space white trash that sold her into slavery for beer money. Luke and Ben? BIG misunderstanding that just got WAY out of hand. All of the mystique built up over the past two years was discarded, seemingly because the director/writer couldn\\'t come up with satisfying answers.*PERSONAL PET PEEVE: No love for Stormtroopers in this movie.That being said, it was not ALL bad. There were some really shining moments in this movie. And despite being tedious in many respects, it\\'s never really boring. The little cameo with Yoda was one of my favorite parts, and the way Luke\\'s face lights up when he sees R2 for the first time in years is really pretty touching. But I have still rated this VERY low, as the negative aspects are too overwhelming for me. I\\'ve heard Abrams is coming back for Ep. IX, which is pretty exciting. But I feel he\\'s got an uphill battle once again, as Last Jedi effectively paved over what he built to make a petting zoo.',\n",
       " 'Quite simply put...it is a spoof, a parody.I think it would be safe to say that The Last Jedi is 85% comedy/15% sci fi.I have no problem with comic relief in a serious film as long as the laughs emerge smoothly within a particular screenplay and do not interfere so heavily with the story that the audience begins to wonder just exactly what the hell they paid good money to see. Water squirts out of Finn\\'s suit at the beginning?! Leia is blown out into space but does not die I guess because she is strong with the Force; or maybe she is just displaying her new superhero abilities?! Snoke is killed by a light saber sitting right next to him?! Snoke\\'s background is never explained. I am assuming the reason for his death is because the screenwriter was either too lazy or too damn dumb to outline any kind of history?! Same can be said for the number one question that has floated around every film goer\\'s mind for the past 24 months...Rey\\'s parents. Every individual fan on the entire planet Earth has forked over their highly detailed theories surrounding this question...hmmm...then forked over some serious cash to find out the answer. What the answer actually (get a grip folks) just happens to be is the one thing nobody ever considered: The screenwriter is too lazy or too damn dumb to care one way or another. She\\'s \"nobody\"?! But wait, low and behold, the laughs are most certainly plenty; Luke throwing the light saber over his shoulder?! Luke \"training\" Rey, her eyes are closed, she reaches out (with her hand), Luke toys with her with a blade of grass on her fingers; that was just NOT what Luke meant when he said reach out (this was actually one of the funniest highlights)?! Finn tries to fly dead on into a certain very big badass weapon only to be stopped by what apparently is Finn\\'s new squeeze (some oriental girl he kinda sorta hooked up with midway through the film, I guess she fell madly in love with him in record breaking time because they shared a tiny Harry Potter style adventure riding these ultra weird gigantic horse/donkey/rabbit/giraff creatures...that were from a race track...outside of this space casino........its a subplot........I think)?! Chewy has a new buddy in the Falcon that is about the size of a pigeon. Yes the pigeon thing is along for the ride?! Oh yeah, Luke rather spectacularly takes on an entire gunline of what looks like a slightly different design of Imperial Walkers from Empire Strikes Back, yes the character of Luke Skywalker is most definitely living it up as a full blown sarcastic laser sword weilding stud puppet, but wait, there is a twist, he\\'s not REALLY there. He presumably is casting his image from his lonely little island, then he, I guess dies?! Yoda also makes a quick cameo, sets a tree on fire, burning some choice pieces of ancient Jedi written word. Afterwards our favorite Jedi master breaks out into a strangely wicked array of laughter that for some oddball reason reminded me of the Emperor?! This film is a comedy. The comedy is literally equal to something you would see in a special features outtakes of just about any movie you purchase on disc. A whole bunch of bloopers and outtakes edited together with some action scenes......Speaking of parodies there was one more thing I forgot to say in my review so I came back to submit a small revision. Some of the laughs in this spoof actually work and some simply miss the target but there was also some that seem to be delivered from the heart. Laughs that you can\\'t help but to thank the Director for being nice enough to shine a light on true comedic nostalgia. There was, undeniably, one scene specifically in this barrel of a million laughs that caught me completely off guard. At one point we see a close up of what looks like a ship landing, then there is a much wider shot of droids holding irons, ironing the bad guy\\'s uniforms (HA HA HA...HEE HEE HEE...PRETTY FUNNY). For about twenty minutes I was thinking, \"...an iron, why an iron, why an...\"(then it hit me). Hardware Wars. I hadn\\'t seen it in over thirty years. I had totally forgotten about it. The 1978 spoof Hardware Wars?! After the movie I went on Youtube to check out some hilarious piece of history. It\\'s probably the funniest Star Wars spoof ever made. If you haven\\'t seen it then I highly recommend it. Yes my childhood has been truthfully resurfaced, it is just as funny now as it was way back in the day.

I'm not sure who Rian Johnson was trying to reach with his screen treatment, but it wasn't me or anyone else in the theater, which was packed, and stone silence from beginning to end.The FX and CGI were fine. That's the only reason I'm doing 3 stars. There was no coherent story. Whatever talents the actors brought to the film were entirely wasted.The more hours of distance I put between myself and the movie, the more I feel violated as a franchise fan. Rogue One was fun. TLJ is a complete and total face splat.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ve been at every movie premier since The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi battle\\'s it out with Episode 1 &amp; 2 for second worst ever. The Force Awakens was great but this current episode/chapter crashes and burns. It is like they found Lawerence Kasdan\\'s evil twin to right this movie!! Jedi history is forgotten and Intergalactic force skyping is in full effect. All the male character\\'s are presented as childish, incompetent, ignorant or evil !?! There is more attention give to campy funny scenes than actual plot development. From out of no where Jedi Masters are obsolete and training is no longer needed and all Force skills come preloaded for Rey!?! Disney creates a Star Wars feminism movie with a dash of politics with the only thing missing was a bumbling Ray Romano. If the roles were reversed between male and females, outrage would ensue throughout the media. I feel very bad for Mark Hamill. The Two major storyline cluster bombs are;1)Luke could not bring himself to Kill Vader (a child killing Dark Sith Lord) but led him back to the light; but was willing to murder his nephew in his sleep?!!??!! 2) None of the Empires ships couldn\\'t just simply light jump ahead and destroy the fleeing ship?If you have a fond childhood memory\\'s of Star Wars this one will put a dent in it for sure. Disney/Commercialism/Politics finally kills the Last Jedi. \"Han shot first!\"',\n",
       " \"This was my greatest fear when Disney bought the franchise: that Star Wars would loose it's soul.This movie has more in common with Fast and Furious and Guardians of the Galaxy than it does with Star Wars. Characters are cartoonish, the dialogue has been watered down and the plot has so many holes you can see right through it. Having said that, both of the other franchises I compared this movie to have made hundreds of millions of dollars, so I guess this movie will also fare well with the masses, for the same reasons: action packed, stunning visuals with an easy-to-digest plot.\",\n",
       " '***SPOILER FREE PART HERE***Where do I begin? I went to the theater having read all the spoiler free reviews this movie got starting from it\\'s release date. So my expectations were at prequel-levels of low if you know what I mean. I knew there was going to be some controversy in the movie but I was like:\"Hey... if they have a backstory or motivation strong enough for me to believe, I\\'ll maybe like it.\" But oh boy I was in for a nightmare. The film started with illogical space scenes, then went to stupid story lines that took the characters from point A to point B to get something from point B only so that in the end all the effort didn\\'t matter. There was little to no background for Luke\\'s way of acting in this movie, I mean he had no strong motivation, which was a problem that I saw the movie had from the beginning to the end which crippled it. Characters were changing motivations like weather and talking drastic decisions just for the sake of taking them without any ramifications or logic towards the future of the franchise. And let me expand this: The movie felt like it was made by 2 types of directors: one that build great climaxes towards huge twists and another one(like 5 years old or something) that would write idiotic conclusion the the twist that let me like: \"what?\" \"how is that possible?\" and no explanation further. Basically it felt as if Ryan Johnson build those moments for huge twists and Disney we\\'re like: \"We\\'ll take it from here!\" I\\'m not really sure that\\'s how it was or if Ryan planned this whole thing himself but it went awfully wrong and felt like a \"Batman and Robin\" disaster. To conclude this: all those awesome game-changing moments from the trailer are just lies meant to drag the audience towards something but actually scr*wing them up after.***SPOILER PART COMING BELLOW!***Ok, so word limit... gotta be quick. From the start the movie goes illogical with that First Order fighter that after is being shot by an X-wing SOMEHOW goes through 6 bomb carriers and destroys them all like they were air, like they wouldn\\'t at least slow him down one at a time, why? I\\'ll tell you, to dramatize the poor situation the resistance was in... and make you enthusiastic for the Resistance that later on when BOMBS FELL FROM BOMB CARRIER IN SPACE(=VOID) TO THAT FIRST ORDER BIG-DESTROYER, ends in a prequelish style the conflict. The movie then shifts to the Rey-Luke story which I found to be the most interesting in the whole movie. She goes to him, hands him the lightsaber and Luke after seeing it, you would think he would wonder how it got to Rey and now to him right? No, comic-relief incoming... throws it over his back. This scene didn\\'t said much at the beginning for me but after seeing the movie I realized that it summarized the whole movie perfectly: A movie that build up greatly towards a game-changing revelation or twist and then slapped you in the face by resolving that twist or revelation so cheap and so immature that I was wondering how in the world could a mature man come up with a story like this. It looked like it was written by a 5-year old at best. Then after some verbal exchanges between them Luke starts to teach Rey 3 lessons in the Force. In one of them he puts Rey to feel the force and she goes instead to the only dark forced place in the island and Luke is like \"you went so easily there\". At that point I was like \"ok, that would be interesting to maybe turn Rey to the Dark Side and bring back Kylo from it.\" That would have been a fantastic story arc. What did the movie do instead? Never mentioned it again. Actually when she is faced with Snoke she is so determined to not be turned to the dark side that just contradicted everything they build on her character in the movie up until then. Let\\'s talk about Kylo: This movie at the beginning builds his character towards accepting more of the Light Side of the force by deciding to not kill his mother(although at how his character eventually becomes it would have been a great build up in Dark Side inside him with that move) and KILLING FREAKING SNOKE. At that point I was like \"ok, again another promising build-up towards him turning to the light-side.\". However the movie after that instantly turns him super-evil just for the sake of having a villain in the movie. Forgot to mention, at on point the movie starts to develop a certain relationship between Rey and Kylo using force-connections in which they talk to another. I tought that could have been an interesting plot change, to make them join forces or maybe become attracted to one another and maybe defeat Snoke together. No, they depart ways because Kylo suddenly wants to kill everyone that tied him to the past and \"bring order to the galaxy\"(Vader style). So from all the possibilities the movie could have gone with this, they chose the most typical and foolish. Ok, going back to Luke, his motivations are incredibly changing throughout the movie and have no background for why they are as they are. So, he trained young Jedi(Ben Solo among them) to discover that Ben had a darkness growing in him because of Snoke? I mean how? The movie doesn\\'t show that and it\\'s as vague about it as was TFA. Suddenly Luke wants to kill Ben. Didn\\'t he think like \"it\\'s my sister\\'s son. Shouldn\\'t I talk to her before murdering her child?\". No, but just decided that because the screenwriter wanted it, otherwise there would not be any explanation. And when you can\\'t explain a character\\'s motivation in a movie without saying that it was the screenwriter\\'s will, then you know he(screenwriter) failed. Here is a piece of dialogue that I thought for Luke to explain his motivations and it would make for a better story for him than the one we got in the movie: \"I tried training new Jedi, but when I saw the darkness growing in Ben I had to do something. If Obi-Wan who trained my father failed at keeping him to the light side, what change could I had with keeping Ben to the light? If Obi-Wan failed, I was going to fail as well, or at least that\\'s what I was convinced at that point. So I had to do something in order to keep the galaxy safe from the rising of another future Sith Lord\". That would have given a little sense to his actions and maybe make him realize that what he tried at that point was wrong. Going back to Leia\\'s supposedly death scene. The control room from the front of the resistance ship where she was standing was destroyed by First Order fighters. We literally see her die and float in space just a while so that out of nowhere in this entire saga, where she didn\\'t care about the force, she comes back to life(using the force apparently) and goes inside the ship near a door and enters the ship to later be put into a coma and come back to health by the end of the movie. I was wondering did the producers knew the actress died right? They also made Kylo\\'s character the new supreme leader and impossible to turn(not even by Leia) to the light-side again, so why there was a reason to keep her alive and not kill her and give her the sent off she deserved? Finn and Rose\\'s story line was interesting but ultimately wasted oportunity. They go to find a master cracker that would get them on Snoke\\'s ship and deactivate the tracker with which the First Order followed the Resistance\\'s cruiser in hyperspace, although the movie never explains how they were tracking the Resistance. They find a cracker other than the one who they were searching for and this one waited for them in a prison. At first I was like \"how convenient that he unlocked the prison door and had the key just when Rose and Finn came\" but later it\\'s revealed that he was actually a \"Lando 2.0\" and that leads to a stupid and short fight or round 2 of Finn vs Phasma. In the end the Resistance finds shelter on a planet and take cover behind a huge door. The First Order comes there and besieges that stronghold. Somehow convinced by ghost of Yoda, Luke comes back but just like a ghost to face Kylo, although him for real would have been a better and more unpredictable scene. After Luke\\'s ghost is discovered he dies on the island and becomes one with the Force because why? Did he actually fought Kylo or was in danger of dying like Obi-Wan was in episode IV? After that somehow Rey comes with the Falcon and helps Finn, Poe and the Resistance to escape from that stronghold by lifting some HUGE AND IMMENSE rocks that she clearly didn\\'t have the training to do so since all she did was argue with Luke and take 3 lessons with him(Luke trained with Obi Wan then with Yoda and was still not prepared enough to face Vader). The final nail in the coffin for this movie was Finn\\'s scene at the end where he goes for that cannon. I was happy to let him die because he was a character that has been build over the course of two movies and a sacrifice like that would have been a fitting end for his story-arc and an ACTUAL SHOCKING TWISTING MOMENT IN THE MOVIE! No! Rose had to save him in the last moment cliché.Aside from that the visuals were top-notch, but what are visuals good at if you don\\'t have a logical story and clever twists? The score: oh boy... such a disappointment. I downloaded it on thursday and listen to it. At first I was: blah... generic iconic music. I said let\\'s try and listen it again, maybe I missed something musical or iconic or thematic... no, it didn\\'t get any better. And that\\'s the problem with John Williams lately: no inspiration whatsoever. He used to write iconic scores that had multiple themes and motifs in them. Now he is composing just generic iconic music like Danny Elfman. Aside from that the acting is pretty good but ultimately wasted with a awful story. I didn\\'t think that there could be a worse movie than TFA. I was wrong and this movie makes TFA look like a masterpiece. That\\'s how bad this joke for a movie is. Officially it has become the worst movie I\\'ve ever seen in my life and by far the worst movie from the Star Wars Saga. 1/10',\n",
       " \"After watching this movie I concluded that the director has either A) never seen a Star Wars movie before or B) is a crying man baby that went on a power trip to annoy the fans.Even the actor who played the main character in the original Star Wars trilogy warned him that he should think about the fans.There are many moments that feel so out of place in the Star Wars universe (spoilers):1.

       " \"I saw the original trilogy in 3 different theaters; the second film at a drive-in, actually, and the third film at a theater overseas. I had both versions of the original trilogy on VHS, the prequel trilogy in DVD's, and at some point I got both trilogies in box set DVD/Blue Ray combos. I got The Force Awakens in the DVD Blue Ray combo, then Rogue One the same way. Force Awakens and Rogue One both had certain things I wished were different, but those few small things were outnumbered and outweighed by greater things which I was grateful to see and experience. Not just nostalgia, but new stuff. A workable balance of old stuff and new stuff, interconnected, to make them fit together like they belong. Force Awakens and Rogue One needed to be that, and they were. Then some astonishingly underqualified folks with zero clues as to what Star Wars is meant to be came along and took a wrecking ball to the entire point of Star Wars, destroying its foundation, and with it, its entire mythology and purpose. Force Awakens had the potential to be one of the greatest Star Wars films, IF its many questions had been answered profoundly in The Last Jedi. Not only were The Force Awakens' questions NOT answered thusly, they weren't answered at all! In fact, many of The Force Awakens' points were outright contradicted! Force Awakens was highly dependent upon Last Jedi to give it its validation, which Last Jedi failed to do, so Last Jedi took Force Awakens down with it. Wasn't there ANYONE involved who could see during the process that this was a disaster in the making? Well of course, there had to be, but they were ignored by the clueless deciders who falsely believe they know best. There was one person in particular who has been involved since the beginning and knew Star Wars almost as well as its creator, and this person knew it was all wrong, but he was pressured to shut up. But you know, he was right. We stand in support of those who gave us the right Star Wars, as much if not more, than we stand against those who gave us the wrong Star Wars. It shouldn't have happened, and there were so many ways for it to have not gone this wrongly. I'd rather have a phoned in poor effort Star Wars than one which was an intentional strong effort to destroy everything Star Wars was and should have continued to be. Power madness is decadence, and Rome fell because of it. I don't have a Last Jedi DVD, and I never will. I didn't see Solo, and I won't. It's over. Star Wars is dead. RIP Star Wars.\",\n",

You can sense the conflicts behind it between Mark Hamill and Rian Johnsson who should have been banned from it as well as Kathleen Kennedy. How she is still with Disney is beyond me.There are loopholes the size of Texas in the story but that´s not the biggest problem.

But, when producers wish to make a sequel, and more so add a chapter to a legendary series, they have to accept that certain character points are non-negotiable.For example, imagine the collective outrage if the next James Bond film shows Bond shooting the Queen, and turning traitor against Ole England!But, in his presentation of the Luke Skywalker character, that\\'s about what Rian Johnson decided to do. Luke Skywalker did not get betrayed by the Dark Side in Kylo Ren, rather Skywalker helped to create it by trying to murder his Padawan in his sleep! And Ren wasn\\'t merely his Padawan -- he was also Skywalker\\'s nephew! Blood is supposed to be thicker than water, which is precisely why one could accept the death of Han Solo. What father cannot be blinded by trying to save his son and putting himself in danger to do so! But, Luke tried to murder his nephew based upon a suspicion of what Ren might do, and not upon anything he had actually done to that point! The character who defied both of his Jedi masters, and put his life in grave danger, to save his own father, decides instead that the life of his nephew is a necessary murder victim because of a sense of future evil in him!This sort of gutless betrayal is something that Jedi simply do not do! If this had been an original film, then the plot twist would have been interesting. But, in betraying the values of the Jedi laid out by seven previous films, Johnson\\'s chosen presentation betrays the canon laid down by George Lucas.This is precisely why Mark Hamill went public with his criticisms of Johnson\\'s treatment of the Skywalker character. The undoubted pressure of Hollywood finally forced Hamill to relent and withdraw his remarks, but one cannot doubt the sincerity of Hamill\\'s initial criticisms, nor their accuracy!Other weaknesses of this film is how Johnson whimsically discarded characters that were created for central roles in the previous film \"The Force Awakens.\" Supreme Leader Snoke was set up to be a powerful wielder of the force. In this film, he is casually killed as one might do to a bumbling idiot! Captain Phasma is set up to be an arch enemy and powerful adversary. In this film, she falls down a hole created in her ship and sucked out to her death early in the film! Benicio Del Toro is a great actor with magnificent promise, but he is rendered a mere footnote in the narrative with little actual screen time.Poe Dameron is presented in The Force Awakens as a seasoned and savvy officer, with all the chops of Han Solo. In this film, he is literally treated as though he\\'s a reckless child, complete with obligatory motherly slap across his face by a character presented as his commanding officer, and erstwhile force wielder Leia Organa. Funny, she never slapped Solo despite the frequent times he tried her patience.The basic narrative of this film can only be explained by Disney wanting to destroy every last remaining character from the Lucas period, and if that clean break was the intent, then mission accomplished!But, in the process, millions of dedicated fans of Star Wars were treated to a gut wrenching betrayal of what previous Star Wars movies represented.

It's just a poor story line by a director that just isn't up to scratch and has made it difficult for the next director to fix the mess he has created.I was being generous with 4/10.

This isn\\'t a Star Wars film, it\\'s a dumb, dark drama with out-of-place childish humor that ignores all established Star Wars world-building and lore, not to mention rejects the mythological fantasy-based storytelling paradigm of the first six films in order to overtly push leftist propaganda. This film is not only offensive, mean-spirited, and nihilistic, it\\'s insulting to its audience\\'s intelligence and goes out of its way to destroy the established character of Luke Skywalker, and degrade General Leia Organa (though this may not have been intentional, her character has an eye-rolling moment in the film that is much better left unseen). Luke is treated like a miserly old coward with no principles or drive to do anything. Leia is given very little screentime and not much to do but react to events in the film.And don\\'t even get me started on the new characters. After all the interesting setup and development in The Force Awakens, Finn is turned into a joke of a character who goes on the most pointless side-quest I\\'ve ever seen in a mega-budget film. Rey, the over-powered protagonist who had SO MUCH potential for a backstory, remains bland and is not challenged or tested by the plot, nor do her actions directly inform it. She is dragged along by the writing and has very little to no agency in this story. And Kylo Ren, though he\\'s well-acted, is badly written, and his character also doesn\\'t go anywhere. Poe Dameron is caught up in place in a subplot that does little else but waste the viewer\\'s time and capacity to care.There are plot holes galore as physics are thrown out the window and themes from the original trilogy and prequels are gleefully subverted and replaced by nothing more than cheap moral platitudes and \"gotcha!\" moments that may wow new viewers who are attracted to edginess and contrarianism, but don\\'t amount to good storytelling. There is nothing cohesive about this film except in how swiftly it erodes what little goodwill Disney had left with longtime Star Wars fans. It is a travesty on every level and I honestly believe Lucasfilm needs a change in management. They ignored Mr. Lucas\\' own stories at their own peril.When you are making a sequel to an established franchise of 40 years, you ignore the established lore, themes, genres, influences, and writing of the previous films at your own peril. If \"Fast and the Furious 9\" began with Vin Diesel fighting alien space worms, you\\'d rightly say it was a \"Riddick\" film. You can\\'t open up with \"yo mama\" jokes in \"Star Wars\" and expect that people who live and breathe this universe aren\\'t going to call you out on it.Check out my essay on Medium, \"On the Character Assassination of Luke Skywalker\".

The women in the bomber which destroyed dreadnought ship, how did she even catch that detonator ?3. During the chase of the rebel fleet how come first order cannot send a few ships (or just one star destroyer) at light speed to cut off rebels right in front of them? I mean the chase goes on like for so long Finn goes to another planet. If there is a reason explain if not then you are taking us for fools. THIS MAKES ENTIRE MOVIE RIDICULOUS!!!4. If entire fleets could be destroyed with the light-speed kamikaze of cruiser class battle ships why build giant star destroyers ? And if i remember right in Star Wars universe uses Hyperspace travel not just lightspeed.5. Luke Skywalker, who did not even kill Darth Vader when he could do it by defiying every kind temptation decides to kill Ben Solo in his sleep. When did he as a jedi master became so corrupt to have such thoughts. 6. Leia just flew in space...Yes by using force in zero gravity you can push yourself to opposite direction but to fly like that while also using force to keep yourself alive one needs such a degree of mastery in the force ...I wont say anymore.7. I watched some random adventure of Finn and a random drama girl with space horses for like how long god knows. And they do not just fail they also get most of the fleet get killed because their code breaker betrays them.8. Next time Yoda should direct that lighting to Kylo Ren...9.

There is way too much forced humour, to the point it is jarring and removes you from the very brief moments in which anything resembling tension (or a real movie) was starting to emerge.The writing was something you'd expect out of a video game or something. Third rate game studio RPGs have better writing.I'd agree with the other reviews in that Rian Johnson made JJ's TFA look like a masterpiece in comparison. JJ's TFA was completely devoid of originality and played it safe, but at least it was executed very well.

To be very clear, this movie isn\\'t just bad because it doesn\\'t fit the Star Wars \"formula\", it is bad because it doesn\\'t fit the \"interesting and engaging cinema\" convention.The pacing and plot are flat out bad. This is not simply a matter of this movie \"Dancing to its\\' own beat\". The flow of the story creates a jarring viewing experience and the plot doesn\\'t movie along with any real purpose. The story itself is strange at best, terrible writing at worst. New characters are introduced with confused motivation and no sense of purpose.

Our new heroes seem to stagnate, especially Finn and Poe.The one exception is possibly Kylo, who is faced with some of the few moments of interesting emotional tension and is well acted by Driver. Rey, a new character I loved in TFA, is in limbo. She doesn\\'t end up having journeyed anywhere as a character through this story. Sure she is put in some challenging situations and faces conflict, but where does it all leave her now? How has she changed or grown?Our old heroes, Luke and Leia seem stuck in a bizarre parody of their former struggles and achievements, Mary Poppins-ing through space and milking alien sea cows. Add to this a drawn out casino sub-plot replete with alien horse race getaway and a few \"wow that looked cool\" moments. I\\'m willing to admit, given some time this might be passable for an afternoon\\'s distraction, maybe on the level of Attack of the Clones, but it is certainly not great cinema and far from a great Star Wars movie. The adoration slathered all over this thing by the mainstream press is beyond bizarre.

       " 'Is it still a Star Wars story? I guess. I don\\'t really know what to feel about it. Having just seen it a few hours ago...I think phrasing it in a nutshell is that: Star Wars is now just a franchise norm, unable to live up to the hype that it had all those years.Well...SPOILERS after this line. Here goes...----------------------------------I thought we would be exploring on the characters Rey, Finn, Poe and the legends like Luke &amp; Leia Skywalker. But it turns out that they are all very two-dimensional now, unfortunately.First off, lets start with Rey. The Force Awakens established her as the main protagonist. So here I thought we would dwell on her more - about her character. But it doesn\\'t seem to go anywhere, other than the fact that her heritage is just from a \"nobody\". A nobody that is able to wield The Force to such extend, that without showing any real \"training\" from Luke...she is able to just do what she does in The Last Jedi. It begs to make me question - even if she does not meet Luke at the end of The Force Awakens, she would eventually know how to do what she does with The Force in all of its aspects that are shown in The Last Jedi because her plot requires her to do so. Like communicating with Kylo Ren light years away or lifting multiple boulders all at once, that could be just as heavy as one single X-Wing, yet she does it with such ease. And the fight she had with Kylo Ren - we did not see Luke train her, but we saw her training herself as Luke looks on. So...I guess her \"training\" happens by being close proximity to a real Jedi Master like Luke Skywalker. Makes me wonder, if she is close to Master Yoda while he was alive, will she be able to command the atmosphere at will too? Since Master Yoda did that in ghost form (I do not want to get started on that Jedi Ghost ability that we witnessed).Next, we have Finn and Poe. One of which is delegated to being the humor relieved character, whom is inexperience and aspiring to be the hero that he should be, while the other is just a hot-headed leader-wannabe. I\\'ll let you guess who is who. Since both are just the same when we were introduced to them in The Force Awakens. Nothing more. Nothing less. As for their stories that they partake in the film...I kept wishing that their subplots would just disappear - so that we can get more screen time for Rey &amp; Luke. That is how disinterested I was.Luke Skywalker. The Jedi Master. Whom now can project himself through galaxies because the plot requires him to do so. I would had think that the writers would actually think of something plausible...but no...they just went with the simple - power of projection. It also makes me wonder, all those while with Master Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda...why didn\\'t they do that in Prequels or in the original trilogy at all?And Leia Skywalker-Solo (bless her soul. RIP Carrie Fisher). The Jedi power that they showed her do...wow...I am sorry...but it does boggle my mind. After all these years of trilogies...I am beginning to ask myself, when did the Star Wars script ever devolves into a Mary Sue state? Oh well...As for the others...I didn\\'t care about the asian ethnicity characters that were introduced. One lived and died in the introduction, and served as a motivation for the other? Whom by the end of the film was just gone, and I do not feel anything at all for that character. But I guess they did it, because China will appreciate it a lot.Supreme Leader Snoke? Whom is supposedly to be so powerful and yet killed off by the middle of the film? WOW....bo-ring. zzz. And Captain Phasma....makes me wonder why they even bother introducing this character in the first place?As for the story itself - well...i guess it is passable. Oh-Kay. So-So. If we treated Star Wars like any other franchise norm. There are dramatic moments. There are easter eggs. There are humor of all kinds that some are almost slapsticky. There are porgs here and there....and everywhere PORGS! I guess toy sales are more important.Well, that is the gist of it all. Just my opinion. My reaction. Will I rewatch it ever again? Probably - only when it is on tele. Maybe others will enjoy The Last Jedi tremendously. And that is good. Go and enjoy yourselves with it. Or just go and check it out for yourselves.

       " 'Last JediIt was 1977 when the world first met a young, wide eyed boy named Luke Skywalker who set out on a galactic adventure. In the intervening decades the character and his accompanying franchise have become a cultural landmark. Star Wars became an event that crossed generation with parents showing the original trilogy (OT) to their kids, who then went as families to see the later prequels (PT). Then those kids grew up, showed their children the OT and the PT before taking their whole family to see 2015\\'s Episode 7 - The Force Awakens. Awakens went on to reinvigorate the film universe as well as being the single biggest box office hit in history. This was achieved by J.J. Abrams\\' steadfast dedication to recreating the feel of the OT with limited CGI, expansive and various practical effects and the inclusion of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. Knowing that across the generations audiences wanted to see Luke the most, J.J. teased us all with a silent 30 second appearance at Awakens end as Rey found him in isolation on an island, extended his family lightsabre to him before cutting to black. After initial excitement died down, some began to suggest that perhaps J.J. had gone too far in trying to recreate the feel of the OT by almost making a remake of a New Hope. The parallels are obvious and numerous - a secret is hidden in a droid on a dessert planet that is closely followed by a galactic army led by mysterious elder force wielder and his young, black clad and mask wearing apprentice. On the dessert planet, the droid meets a down on their luck, good hearted person who wants to help the droid complete its mission, dragging them in to the larger galactic conflict between the forces of evil and its resistance. Then, meeting an older mentor who reveals the reality of the force and the Jedi, the group board the Millennium Falcon, visit an alien populated drinking hole before taking on a giant space laser to save the rebels on which the young hero sees their new mentor stuck down. In the place of Luke, we had Rey with an accompanying mystery as to her parentage and what led to her being abandoned on the dust bowl of Jakku. On the Dark Side of things, we had Kylo Ren, son of Han Solo, who betrayed Luke many years ago and aligned with the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke. Han Solo himself was the glue that held together much of Awakens bridging the gap between the generations of fans and films. Harrison Ford managed to recapture his character, albeit more wizened than before, earning a mostly decent send off from the franchise. Going in to the Last Jedi J.J. had managed to re-establish the universe, introduce a plethora of new characters while respecting the original films and characters. There were many intriguing questions left hanging at the end, who is Rey? How is she so powerful? Who is Snoke? Where did he come from? What happened between Luke and Ren that sent him to exile? Will Luke return to the fray? Will Ren now be more powerful after killing his father to embrace the Dark Side? Did Snoke trick Ren in to betraying Luke?So, with new writer/Director Rian Johnson stepping up to a big budget for the first time, how did he sync up with what had been made before?Unusually for a Star Wars film, Last Jedi picks up literally minutes after the credits rolled on Awakens with the rebels abandoning the base now known to the First Order and Rey still standing in front of Luke. Narratively the films timeline is quite nebulous, never giving you any reference when anything is happening in relation to anything else. The main threads follow the last of the Rebel fleet stuck in a crawling chase away from the pursuing First Order with seemingly no escape and the joint narrative of Rey trying to learn from Luke and Ren trying to learn from Snoke. Finn is relegated to a D-plot involving chasing down a hacker to help the rebel fleet escape the Order that goes utterly nowhere. The opening is what at first glance should be a wonderful set piece of Poe Dameron facing down a Dreadnought (a super-duper sized Star Destroyer) in a single X-Wing but is undermined by some strange, Marvel-like humour and a bizarre lack of attention to detail. The concern many had when Lucasfilm got purchased was the \"Disneyfication\" of the films, which the attempts at laughs in Last Jedi certainly feel like. The action is undercut by a seeming ignorance to how space works with Rebel Bombers physically dropping bombs down on to ships ignoring the absence of strong gravity and the First Order arcing their shots at the Rebel Fleet, again, ignoring the absence of gravity. The film carries this lack of attention the details throughout repeatedly breaking immersion, undermining any tension or excitement. To Johnson\\'s credit, everything is shot beautifully. Some of what is created here provides the franchise with some of its best visuals, be it space battles or simpler shots of vistas and characters. Perhaps, like an inversion of the franchises creator, Johnson should have stuck to just directing as the writing choices and presentation is mostly poor. 20-45 minutes of the film could and should have been cut to allow the better stories to breathe. John Boyega is reduced to being a secondary character in a 4th level narrative serving simply as a soundboard made up of various reactionary noises. The character he accompanies, Rose, likely would be forgettable if not for her god-awful involvement in the final act, disrupting what would have been a greater emotional arc for other characters. Rose is not, however, the worst written character as that ignoble honour goes to Laura Dern\\'s Vice-Admiral Holdo. Serving as the short-term head of the rebel fleet, the writing is so illogical as to be infuriating. Immediately refusing to work with Poe and refusing to share her plan for survival presents her as potentially interesting but unfortunately her refusal to share is only a tool to keep information from the audience. Withholding the information is maddeningly illogical, particularly when a single line of dialogue as to why could have resolved it. Further, the film trying to treat Holdo as amazing for her bad choices only deepens the frustration.Naturally, the story everyone wants to see is Mark Hamill\\'s return as Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. From the first moment of Luke receiving his family\\'s lightsabre that he last saw falling down a shaft in cloud city, still gripped by the hand his father, Darth Vader, just lopped off, the tone of his character is just so far from the Luke we previously met. True enough, its been decades since he went in to exile but his temperament, actions and packaging just ring hollow compared to the character we watch develop over three films. An eternal optimist, Luke believed so much in good that he fought to bring it out of the second most evil person in the galaxy but here has none of that spirit. Rey is a nuisance to him as he refuses to train or help her, which is fortunate as Rey seems totally proficient in lightsabre combat and force powers already. J.J. set up her character to have a justification for her powers in Awakens but Johnson makes no effort to explain. The other story threads created by J.J. for the sequels, including the mystery surrounding Snoke, are either unanswered or deliberately contrarian resolutions. Johnson seems to have no interest in dealing with any of the questions set up by J.J. and seems on focused on executing his vision of, as Kylo would say, letting the past die and killing it if he has to. Sadly, after all the furore of Awakens bringing Star Wars back to like, Rian Johnson seems to have gone out of his way to undermine any potential for the future. By being more concerned with politicising half his film and destroying the history of the other half, he has created a barely cohesive film. Without the Star Wars name, it\\'s likely this would be a barely average viewing experience but with the Star Wars logo it has to be seen as more disappointing, given the cultural significance and the unlimited potential the universe holds. Originally, Disney were to give Johnson his own trilogy but if this is what he thinks of Star Wars, we can only hope that no promises were made. With Colin Trevarrow departing Episode 9, the Solo...solo film having innumerable problems, its possible Rian Johnson\\'s Last Jedi will be seen as another turning point in the history of Star Wars, and not a turning point for the better.

It had all that nostalgia which I associated with Starwars plus awesome CGI and action sequences, even though the story was exactly \"A New Hope\". I was actually looking forward to this second instalment hoping that it would keep all the new awesome things from Force Awakens but give us a new story and not just rehash Empire. What we get is a mis-mash of unconvincing story-lines and disappointment after disappointment for the entire duration of the film.First the story line, we all wanted to know answers for why Luke abandoned everything and exiled himself when the resistance desperately needed him, why Ray has that special connection with the force and her actual story, who Snoke was and how he suddenly became all that powerful with multiple death-stars and fleets of army and followers!! I though all ended hunky-dory in the Return Of the Jedi and the empire was crushed. So this film does answer a few of these questions, but none of them are strong enough to develop a liking towards these characters or agree that all the decisions these characters make are justifiable. The reason for Luke\\'s exile is just plain dumb and he changes his mind in an instant with a few broken sentences from ghost Yoda, who by the way still has powers to physically alter events even after his death!Ray\\'s backstory was just a single line and the cosmic connection between her and Kylo was just painful to watch. Snoke on the other hand is all powerful and manipulates minds but still cannot guess a simple mind change which his apprentice has. And there is no explanation whatsoever about how he is suddenly all powerful and is the master of the galaxies!!Second, the disappointments!! My god, this film is full of them. No plan the resistance makes it successful until the last scene. They keep loosing and loosing with very-very minimal success throughout the entire very-very lengthy 152 minute duration of the film!! This is really painful and frustrating to watch. (Feels like Negan has jumped ship onto the StarWars universe and is tormenting the heroes with his success!!) Every plot which the resistance makes fails. Heavy spoilers here guys so please watch the movie before reading my review. The first big plan to recklessly continue fighting by Poe Dameron results in heavy loss, of both people and battle ships. Then then next hyper-jump escape fails with Empire quickly catching up and blasting away Resistance\\'s ships. Then the whole sub-plot with Finn and Rose for finding the code-breaker fails, Ray\\'s plan to infiltrate and change Kaylo\\'s mind fails, the resistance\\'s plan to jump to smaller ships and escape fails and nearly their entire crew gets wiped out and finally, their blast door, their almost last hope, falls in fraction of seconds!! The title for this film instead should have been \"StarWars - Empire Crushes The Resistance\" I, like the rest of us, like to see victory even though there are initial failures by the good side. But when the good side falls over and over, it really is damn right frustrating. Similar was the case with Rogue one. It was like the writers started the film using this principle - everyone/everything from the good side must die in the end, so lets all build the story, drama, etc. and then crush them in the last moments of the battle. Lots of the deaths were really unnecessary in Rouge One, but ya, the characters never get mentioned in the trilogy, so lets kill then all, one by one! Not the force or the resistance can do one little thing to protect them!And now lets talk about the force, the film makes really took liberties here. Force can now send a 3D projection across the galaxy and it is not just a 3D projection, but a projection which can stop the lightsaber attack but still it can pass though the body without causing any harm! Force can now act as an intergalactic FaceTime with touch and feel capability. Almost makes the whole message in a droid thing pointless! Then, the most ridiculous of it all, Jedi, even after being dead, can exert powers and destroy things. So why don\\'t Yoda, Obi-wan, Anakin and other deceased Jedis gang up and rain thunder bolts on the Empire!! This liberal use of force was plain stupid!Finally, guess I will have to talk about the positives, even though it doesn\\'t alter my perception. The CGI and cinematography is near perfect. We get some decent performances by the lead cast especially from Daisy Ridley who seemed to have groomed a lot since the first film. She no longer looks like this skinny, weird kid instead looks like a beautiful woman hell bent on learning her place in the struggle and keeping the dark side out. And finally, Princess Leia, she is a delight to watch in every scene and will be sorely missed.So, in conclusion, J.J should have made this film and not pass on the mantle. At least The Force Awakens, despite being the same story as New Hope, was fun to watch. Lets hope, they make it up in the grand finale in 2019. My New Hope to see an exciting StarWars film still remains afloat!!',\n",
       " 'First of all, how can this movie be rated 7+ stars on IMDB? There must be some strange hacking-magic at work on this website, in order to save Disney\\'s reputation. I\\'ve been a fan of Star Wars since I watched \"The Last Hope\" (at the drive-in) way back in 1977, and have loved it ever since then. While the prequels were mediocre at best, they still \"felt\" like Star Wars films, and I only criticized Episode I for its obvious flaws. However, Episode VII was the beginning of the end for the Star Wars franchise, and Episode VIII sent the franchise into a horrible oblivion. I left the theater feeling empty, extremely disappointed, and feeling as if my admiration and loyalty to the franchise had been completely stripped away after a 2+ hour viewing of this nonsense. Having said all of this, I did very much enjoy \"Rogue One\" and although it had some flaws, it was highly entertaining and \"felt\" like a Star Wars film, unlike episodes VII and VIII. \"The Last Jedi\" was a gigantic pile of trash, and anyone who defends it with a review (score) of anything higher than 5 should seriously stop watching movies for a while, or at least stop posting their reviews about them. In the meantime, I\\'ll pretend that I never watched this, and the world will (again) become a better place.',\n",
       " 'The Force Awakens was a bad Star Wars movie. This is far worse.If only Mark Hamill had refused this script. Who knows how good a movie this might have been had Rian Johnson been forced to rewrite it.The Last Jedi is an insult to the Star Wars universe. I saw the original a dozen times, each time being filled with awe and wonder.This movie filled me with disgust. It gets three star for special effects, and some genuine humour.',\n",
       " 'This movie is embarrassing all Star Wars Universe, not worth to watch. the first movie was super bad enough, and this.... this is just way more idiotic movie. Jedi is not God. all new nonsense power all new rules, new boundary and the character are just idiotic. A darth with too much emotion and such a crybaby. it disgust me.',\n",
       " '90% of this movie was hot garbage. Most of the story is pointless and the parts that do matter are just remedial. One or two shining moments in the film, other then that a complete waste of your time. I will never understand how this movie is rated so high, Disney must have paid a pretty penny for good reviews.',\n",
       " 'The film is a mess from start to finish, if you thought Jar Jar Binks was bad wait till you see this. It\\'s so bad that I don\\'t even know where to begin. It\\'s by far the worst and most uninspired Star Wars ever made up to this point in time. Bad to a point where if weren\\'t for the light sabers -- sorry they are now officially called \"laser swords\" -- you wouldn\\'t even recognize it as being a Star Wars film. Jar Jar Binks I miss you.',\n",
       " 'There were times in this movie where I honestly believed the scene in question would serve better as a skit in Robot Chicken Star Wars. There were other times when the movie became Harry Potter... new force spells galore.There appears to be some sort of a vacuum when it comes to hiring the right talent in imagining up dark characters. Almost everyone who is supposed to be \"dark\" or \"evil\" is little more than an angry hormonal teenager. Daisy Ridley plays Rey as well as the story allows, and Finn and Poe are their usual selves. Unfortunately for us, what the story allows is a retelling (yet again) of what the force is capable of, and a rehash of (yet again) all the predictable twists. I think Disney should turn this whole thing into an animated series... perhaps create a young princess leia and simply make it all about love and babies. You know, stick to your strengths.',\n",

       " \"Running out of fuel? If I was the director I'd look for another job. You've ruined the best thing to ever come on the cinema. You should donate all profits to a charity as the film is not worth making money off the back of Star Wars fans. Rogue one was a much better film in every way. That's how a modern Star Wars film is made.\",\n",
       " 'Went to see the movie with my dad (both of us are life-long Star Wars fans), expecting to see another great chapter in the saga. Unfortunately, everything that made Star Wars the great movies that they are, are no where to be seen. Where are the characters we are supposed to care about? This is Star Wars, where are the lightsaber battles, besides that whatever it was with kylo, rey, and the red guys. Worst of all, the totally deflating, slap in the face, last \"battle\" for Luke. The movie was so boring that I looked at my watch quite a few times to see when this would ever end and even almost feel asleep watching this movie. We left with a feeling of disbelief, anger, and shock.Before I wrote this, I wanted to see what others were saying to see if I was being too hard on the film or maybe I missed something. after looking through tons of reviews, I realized I was in the majority, despite the off the wall 7.4 rating this movie supposedly has. What was really telling for me while reading the reviews, was the details given for why people liked or hated the movie. The majority of the people who hated the movie gave exact details on what they didn\\'t like and why. The handful of good reviews were for the most part very generic....ok you loved the direction that so and so took, well that\\'s great, but what SPECIFICALLY did you like about the direction? Those good review specifics are VERY few and far between. So take from that what you will. This is not my star wars and definitely NOT my luke skywalker. I could actually care less about seeing IX and what happens to the characters who we are supposed to care about but don\\'t.',\n",
       " 'A couple of years ago, it appeared that a 14yo girl saw the original Star Wars trilogy and decided to re-write the original 1977 film as a fanfic with herself as an über-powered Mary Sue who instinctively had the powers of a Jedi and more of Han Solo\\'s piloting skills than he had in his own ship. Not only that, but she had perfect skin, teeth, and hair despite living on a desert planet, orphaned at a young age and scraping by on scrap metal sales. She had no scars, body marks, burns or anything else--she was a flawless little princess in an extremely hostile (yes, I deployed to the Middle East in the early 1990s) environment. The rest of the story we know, because that fanfic was turned into a movie, The Force Awakens.The Last Jedi is the fanfic her daddy wrote, to make all the mean people go away by playing fast &amp; loose with forty years of preexisting lore so that it made his baby girl even more impressive. The easiest thing in the world is to look at an established lore and say \"that, plus me, times infinity,\" which is what they did with Rey AND Snoke (which is the kind of name a child gives a snot-based villain).We\\'re required to believe that the First Order has all but destroyed the Resistance, but just like The Party\\'s propaganda against Immanuel Goldstein in 1984, the former are only portrayed as clumsy buffoons against the latter\\'s pluck and daring. I guess they were trying for a \"girl power\" angle on the Resistance fleet, with two women in charge. But when male villains are comically inept--and the girls still run away--it turns female empowerment into a farce because there are no real stakes against an incompetent opponent.We\\'re required to believe that Luke Skywalker tossed aside his father\\'s (and later his own) lightsaber--the only remaining item of the good in the man--as immaterial.We\\'re required to believe that a neophyte has all (if not more than) the knowledge of a Jedi master, without training, and that she came not from force-sensitive parents but from random civilians with no unique traits. Didn\\'t we already have this character, named Bella Swan?There\\'s a useless middle section about the evils of wealth and animal abuse which does not belong in the story. A single line from Laura Dern\\'s vice admiral could have saved us this tedium. Nostalgia Critic calls this a \"big-lipped alligator moment,\" but this is easily 1/4 of the film--it serves no purpose other than filling time.We\\'re required to believe that the man who led the Rebellion, destroyed the Death Star, defeated the Emperor, brought Vader back from the Dark Side, and restored order to the galaxy has become a cowardly recluse because ONE student started going bad. This is the sort of wish-fulfillment a teenager writes about himself after being kicked out of school. We also learn that Yoda was available to advise him as a force ghost, but chose instead to undermine him and destroy the legacy he spent 900 years to build. It\\'s a bit like that godawful trend in Marvel Comics where the \"classic\" hero meets the new SJW version, has an epiphany and realizes that the latter is a better product, and that he (the classic) should bend the knee.We\\'re required to believe that the snot-based villain predates the Empire and is more powerful than Palpatine, but his evil consists mostly of saying \"I knew that\" and making snarky remarks at his emo apprentice, which undermines his own credibility and sets up the \"your overconfidence is your weakness\" strike you see coming ten miles away.We\\'re required to believe that the Resistance\\'s survival will be threatened because... well, in The Empire Strikes Back the Imperial fleet couldn\\'t bombard Hoth from orbit and sent walkers instead. But no such barrier exists here and the land-based attack just drags out the run time.It\\'s obvious that this poor imitation of a Star Wars film was intended to provoke emotions in people who can\\'t maintain intellectual consistency from one moment to the next, but want to be associated with something greater than they are capable of handling. Han\\'s gone, Luke\\'s gone, and Carrie Fisher can\\'t reprise her role. That leaves Lando, Chewbacca &amp; the droids as the last vestiges of the original series for Disney to throw under the bus for Episode IX: The Final Cash Grab.',\n",
       " \"I was pretty disappointed with episode VII (too much fan service, rehash of episode IV and a universe that simply lacked depth and detail), but the latest installment is much, much worse. Not only are we given zero explanation to the tons of unanswered questions episode VII left us with (who is Snoke? Where did he come from and how did he affect Ben Solo? What is the Knights of Ren, WHERE are the friggin Knights of Ren??), but the movie is such a bore, filled with pointless new characters. Rose, DJ, Holdo (what's up with that purple hair?), ridicolous scenes with a casino, some giant space horses, repeated telepathic chats between Ren and Rey and a space chase that last the entirety of the movie. There is close to no plot, and the stuff about Luke - and what he has done - is highly unbelievable. The main characters Rey and especially Finn are such bores this time around, they have close to no personality. I really don't understand what Rian Johnson was trying to do - what an unbelievable mess!\",\n",
       " \"Do you remember a time that Star Wars films were cool and they had actors that weren't wooden toys. So do I while Disney has created some great movies over the years. It's 3 Star Wars films are not and this last attempt and resurrecting an old franchise has fallen on death ears. While children that have not watched the films are treated to disney at it's so called fiWe remember the scenes that made the movies like the death of Luke's aunt and unkle in episode 4, Han frozen in episode 5 Luke's struggle against the dark side in episode 6.While there is some great flash and bang scenes and generally what you might want from a Star Wars film. It's missing something like the connection to the hundreds of books that got spawned from the series. Great job mr Abrams for being to lazy to read the continuum and leaving the writing to writers or the so called hacks that wrote this story. The fact is this movie is a sad representation of what Star Wars really is. Fans expect a Star Wars film not the next Pixar film involving buzz light year as Rey and woody as Finn. Not even the 3 new mains of the film come to our attention like the names Carrie fisher, Harrison ford and co. I'm not saying not to watch the film just don't expect to see the Star Wars the we love on the screen\",\n",
       " 'This movie was completely pointless....neither the plot nor the characters are really in a place different than they were when TFA ended. We can\\'t be distracted by ridiculous new creatures and flashy special effects. This was a long, drawn out, meaningless movie. Finn, who was (imho) the most important and original of the new characters introduced in TFA, was given a pointless *side* plot for what? To devote more time to telling Kylo Ren\\'s lame back story? There was little to no rising action and I couldn\\'t even pinpoint the climax of the plot for you because it was such a mess. So much of the hype going into the movie (who are Rey\\'s parents? who is Snoke? etc) was quickly dismissed. Amazing actors like John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran were seriously under utilized.I give this move 2 stars: one for the acting of John, Kelly, Oscar, and Carrie because they are all amazing and their presence alone would have made me more than happy to see this movie but they were either under utilized, given demeaning plot lines, or both, so I can really only add one star for them. And one star for the special effects team because they did a really good job and it\\'s not their fault the story was so bad it was up to them to make the movie entertaining somehow.I\\'d also like to say that I\\'m sick of all the patronizing humor in these movies. Or really every new movie in general. It\\'s very contrived and honestly off putting. There\\'s a difference between genuine camp and unoriginal, stereotypical \"humor\" which is more often than not inserted into the most bizarre situations that it manages to achieve an even greater level of tone deaf and unpleasantness. This sort of \"humor\" is in a lot of new movies so I guess I can\\'t really fault TLJ for it but still. I\\'d hoped Star Wars would be different.Disney/Lucasfilms listen up!! If you want to make a good Star Wars movie you should check out fan theories. There\\'s a lot really great stuff out there!!! Pay those people for their incredible and inspired ideas and storytelling. That\\'s a movie I\\'d probably see more than once! This one? Maybe if the DVD comes to my local library and every other DVD is checked out that day.',\n",
       " \"Ever since I was a small child, I was fascinated with Star Wars. I vividly remember the first time I saw the movies in the cinema when they got a rerun in 1997. I was and still am in love with Star Wars. I grew up with it, watched everything, read the books, played the games and collected the toys. To me, Star Wars is more than just a movie it is my Childhood and still a very important part of my life.When I first heard the announcement that Disney bought the rights to Star Wars and more movies were on the way, I was excited for new possibilities. The Force Awakens, despite its flaws and similarities felt like a Star Wars movie and played homage to the older movies. J.J. Abrams managed to create a successful entry point to a new trilogy with likeable and complex characters, charm and wit. It was the start of something great, the necessary similarities set the boundaries for a successful continuation. The first part in the trilogy left me wondering what would happen next, who are Rey's parents, how could Supreme Leader Snoke seize power. I was excited for the future. Fast forward to the current day, I have seen the movie twice now and I am heartbroken and confused as to how it could go so wrong. The movie starts with a dire situation for the Resistance their ships have been found and are faced with superior numbers from the First Order. The foolish but likeable character Poe Dameron faces off with a Dreadnought to gain enough time for the Resistance to escape. This already starts off one of my major gripes about this movie. The dialogues and the forced slapstick humor just does not fit the grandeur of this movie. The conversation between General Hux and Poe is laughable, but not in a good way. The joke at the expense of Hux discounts the seriousness of the situation and this slapstick runs like a common thread throughout the movie. The Last Jedi resembles other Disney projects such as the Marvel Franchise in this regard; every action has to be commentated with a joke, because of fear that the viewers could lose interest in the subpar storylines. While the battle is developing, the Resistance manages to attack the Dreadnought with their Bomber Squadron and destroying it in the process. Unfortunately, nobody told Director Rian Johnson, that Bombs should be floating in space, but gravity is ignored in this instance.In the subsequent battle, Kylo Ren and two Tie-Fighters destroy the bridge of the main Battleship of the Resistance. The whole leadership of the Resistance, including Admiral Ackbar, is wiped out, except for Leia that is hovering in through space in zero gravity. Leia then escapes death by using the force to fly through space with her best Mary Poppins imitation to get back to the Battleship, in what can only be described as the most unreasonable and unrealistic moment of the whole franchise. While she has shown that she is force sensitive in the past, this felt like a cheap and unnecessary way to advance the plot. It also doesn't have any influence on the advancement of the overall plot whether she lives or dies, but would have been a good opportunity to send of the late Carrie Fisher.In a plan to escape from the grasp of the First Order, Finn and Rose Tico, a crewmember of the Resistance, set forth on a journey to the planet Canto Bight in order to search for a code cracker that will insure the Resistance a safe escape. The whole scene felt more like it descended from the Harry Potter franchise than Star Wars, gone are familiar alien races and they get replaced by money loving caricatures of society. The whole Plot felt like it tried to lecture the audience and Finn and Rose had no on screen chemistry. This part could have been cut from the movie and would have made it a stronger movie overall.At the same time, Rey finally meets Luke Skywalker on the Island, where the first Jedi once lived. We get to know more about the reasons why Luke decided to live on this desolate island. This storyline overall felt authentic, but has one glaring issue that goes against everything the Star Wars franchise stands for, the creation of Kylo Ren at the hands of Luke Skywalker. Fearing the imminent turn to the dark side of Ben Solo, Luke raises his Lightsaber to strike down a sleeping Kylo Ren. Luke Skywalker, the most powerful Jedi that brought balance to the force, gives up hope to kill the Son of his best friend Han Solo and Leia Organa, his own sister, despite infringing on the very principle that defines a Jedi. This is an unreasonable character trait that does not fit the Luke Skywalker that everyone grew to love from the original trilogy. This part of the story had the same weaknesses that plagued the rest of the movie; important scenes were ruined with slapstick humor that was not fitting the tone of the situation. Later on, Rey confronts Snoke and Kylo Ren on their main Ship and ensuing scenes are very well orchestrated. Still, Supreme Leader Snoke feels like a missed opportunity. We do not get to know how Snoke obtained his position or even who he really is. He is depicted as an almost almighty deity that feels untouchable, but his hubris is ultimately his downfall. The Choreography and visual effects are top notch and the movie starts to drastically pick up from the moment Rey steps food on the First Order Ship.Finn and Roses plan to save the Resistance fails, but BB8, that seems like an unstoppable killing machine in this movie, safes them once more whilst controlling an AT-ST, after single handedly beating multiple guards back on Canto Bight. The mutiny subplot between General Holdo and Poe is going on at the same time and their performances and believable character traits make this one of the highlights of the movie. While I liked this subplot, the whole problem could have been entirely eradicated, if Poe and Holdo talked about their plans. The scene ends with Holdo sacrificing herself in order to save the last surviving escape pods, by ramming the Resistance Ship into the First Order Ship, but only doing so, after basically killing of the vast majority of the Resistance Ships. The magnitude of the exploding First Order Ship gets reduced again by slapstick humor and dialogue that feels completely out of place. Captain Phasma, an intriguing character from the Force Awakens, that did not see nearly enough screen time, does not get used to the full potential and finds death without ever achieving anything meaningful.The final battle happens on the salt planet Crait, the Resistance surrounded by the First Order and Finn and the others go on the offense with some speeder like ships. Finn is ready to sacrifice himself in order for the success of the Resistance, but gets stopped at the last second by Rose, that selfishly decided she was more important than the chance of overall survival, despite highlighting over the movie, that solidarity and believe in the Resistance is crucial.Luke Skywalker appears as an Illusion, unknowingly to Kylo Ren and manages to buy enough time to get the Resistance to safety. He finally manages to find peace and balance with the force and dies in the process. Overall, the Soundtrack, the Sound effects and the Visual effects are stunning. The action is great and if this is enough for the average viewer to be entertained, this movie can be ideal. The problems start with the implausible and the shoddy dialogue and leave much to be desired. Some characters get fleshed out, while others seem to be forgotten. The chemistry between Finn and Rose is simply not there and the movie would have been better without the whole love story in it. I can´t imagine that hardcore fans of Star Wars can be happy with what was achieved by Rian Johnson, he does not seem to be the right guy to lead the next trilogy. Unfortunately the positive aspects do not manage to redeem the glaring issues of this long awaited second part in the sequel trilogy. I left the cinema feeling disappointed and I am now less enthusiastic about Star Wars future movies.\",\n",

       " 'With \\'The Last Jedi\\' Star Wars has ultimately become a parody - a mocking imitation - of itself. Although traces of this were already visible in \\'The Force Awakens\\' this movie takes parody to another level which almost already borders on ridicule. There are two elements in the movie which turn the once epic space opera saga into a parody of itself - the \"twistmania\" and the almost Marvel-like attempt to cram as much humor in this movie as possible.TWISTMANIA: A (single) twist can be a wonderful narrative device if it suddenly takes the plot in a completely new direction or sheds a new light on the entire plot when it occurs towards the ending of a movie (e.g. in Flightplan). In \\'The Last Jedi\\' Rian Johnson\\'s main idea seems to have been to create a movie that thwarts viewer expectations at every turn / twist. The problem with the various twists in the movie lies in the fact that they willfully destroy emotionally-intense and potentially epic scenes (Luke takes the lightsaber just to toss it carelessly over his shoulder, the new main-enemy Snoke is simply unceremoniously killed off, Finn\\'s heroic self-sacrifice for the Resistance is prevented by Rose\\'s intervention). Moreover, there are simply too many twists in the movie which makes it seem as if it was constructed around the twists instead of being a coherent narrative which contains twists.MARVEL-ESQUE HUMOR: Similarly to the hugely popular Marvel superhero movies which employ a lot of humor in order to make their movies more enjoyable for a general audience, \\'The Last Jedi\\' is crammed with humor which mostly remains flat (Luke\\'s tickling of Rey\\'s fingers when she physically reaches out instead of with her mind, Luke dusting off his cape on Crait, BB-8 shooting coins (!) at enemies) or is even cringeworthy (Poe\\'s your-mother-joke at the beginning, General Hux\\'s chronic incompetence, Luke and Leia\\'s reunion which spins around a discussion about hairstyles).In general, \\'The Last Jedi\\' is not so much a compelling, interesting new chapter in the epic Star Wars saga but a parody which proclaims to be a Star Wars movie which uses known characters, settings, and narrative patterns but never takes them (or even itself) seriously. While this might be hugely enjoyable if this was a real Star Wars parody (like Spaceballs and the Family Guy Star Wars episodes), the movie unfortunately lacks the spirit of the original Star Wars movies and ultimately remains a mediocre science fiction adventure comedy which does not live up to the magnificent universe which George Lucas created in the 1970s.',\n",
       " 'Laziest writing ever, totally boring storylines, characters make no sense, the force has become a bunch of magic tricks. Episodes I-III are absolute milestones of film making compared to this. I was going into this with zero expectations but was still disappointed. Actually shocked.',\n",
       " \"I tried so hard to like this, I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. As a big fan of star wars I was very disappointed by this movie, so many storylines that went nowhere, boring annoying characters, terrible treatment e'd legacy characters. Just give it a skip\",\n",
       " \"Rian Johnson you suck, you ruined the story and character of Luke Skywalker. Laura Dern you suck with your unnecessary feminism crap. This movie sucks my balls. Don't make another one PLEASE, pull the plug who ever is in charge.\",\n",
       " \"First off everyone is wondering how this movie tile got 7.7 out of 10 stars now down to 7.4 stars which is still way to many stars for this title and how all the critics seem to say this is one of the best star wars created yet. Well it all comes down to money Disney paid 2 billion dollars to get this franchise there is no way they are going to lose money on this or break even that is not a profitable business. Also Disney needs to keep making money on this title after it gets old an by it having a very low rating or getting negative reviews by all the critics a new comer to the franchise might be discourage and not want to waste the time to watch it or buy it. This is disappointing me that IMDB a trusted site of mine would sell out a long with the critics but sometimes that is what you got to do to stay in the business. Now the problem is that star wars was a great fantasy world with a very interesting story and something new in each episode created (even star wars episodes 1-3 in my opinion deserve 8 stars as well). This series has flopped because Disney is as stated above in the business to make money an they do that very well but normally the mvoies they make are cartoon movies geared at the younger generation with the intent to sell toys or family orientated like Mary Popins that parents can take their kids to. This is why Disney making the new star wars was a bad idea star wars was not made to sell a bunch of junk to little kids or band wagon fanboys it was a movie for adults who liked the fantasy world and others getting into the fantasy world. Even though Disney has trashed star wars they are genius for making JJ. Abrams who is one of the worst writers and directors of our time to headline this movie because that is exactly what he does sells junk to people who do not understand good movies. An if you don't think JJ. Abrams had a hand in The Last Jedi you would be wrong this movie stinks of him watch some of his other movies if you can sit through them and than re watch this movie again if you can sit through it. Although JJ. Abrams was not mentioned in this title I bet he was pulling most of the strings, but if you want to put all the blame on Rian Johnson that is up to you. Also if you look at Rian Johnson's other works most of those titles are actually good so why wouldn't he try an take another chance at making another great film. Lastly if you watch the side movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story that is a much better movie than the main one because it has no affiliation with JJ. Abrams (still not as good as star wars episodes 1-6 but a mediocre movie if you want something to watch).Now onto the movie its self it has been about a year since I have seen this movie but i couldn't hold back and had to write something so some of what i write might not be everything but ill try to keep it close now can i say that hasn't already been said. The opening scene with the prank phone call by Poe Dameron to buy time for the fleet to get into position to take out the juggernaut was one of the dumbest things i have seen in a while. Only a child would laugh at something like this but like I said previously this is something JJ. Abrams would do an if i missed it and star wars is now a fantasy comedy i can honestly say any jar jar binks scene was better than this one. Now the action scene following this was ok but the fantasy world need a good story to go along with it or else its just a mindless movie with action clips in it. Next section i would like to touch on is Luke Skywalker teaching Rey who is already an accomplish warrior that has never meet a real jedi in her entire life but can defeat someone who has already been trained by a sith lord and has all the jedi powers of a master jedi with zero training. For instance when Luke has decided to help Rey with her training and they are on the cliff and he tells her to look deep into the force. Which Rey has not problem with she instantly is able to grow her powers without any struggle at all but while doing that she finds a dark and evil hole and now has to find it so she can see what its all about. when Rey finds the hole she gets sucked in and finds a mirror inside where hundreds of reflections of herself are looking back at her and you cant forget about the annoying finger snap that seems to echo throughout the entire mirror. This is supposed to be something that helps you with the story but i still cant seem to figure out what the point of it was. This is also a take away from the empire strikes back, but in the empire strikes back Luke fights a fake Darth vader chops his head off after he wins he sees himself in vaders mask which some people can say oh that's say if you get seduce by the dark side you will end up just like vader or you can say it has something to do with vader being Lukes son but that isnt revealed until return of the jedi either way it helped make a good plot hole in the story and made you think. The scene with Rey did none of the above and you were just happy when she got out of that hole. Onto the casino scene where Finn and Rose have to find the code breaker so the rebel fleet could escape the empire fleet that whole part of the movie yet again was very uncreative most of it was just CGI scenes and stuff to market for little kids. The main reason why i mention this part is the scene where Finn and Rose ride through the casino on fathier's wrecking everything in sight is a straight up JJ Abrams move that is something he loves to do in all his movies and yet again he had nothing to do with this movie. I could go on and on but dont feel like writing a book so ill cut the rest short. The progs on the millennium falcon just trying to sell junk, snokes death yet again stupid but they had to get rid of him because the writers are not creative enough to come up with something to make him a good part of the story, pincless Leia floating back from outer space one of the worst parts of the movie, captain phasma fight I forgot who this guy even was because the force awakens was just as bad as this movie, Yoda showing up out of nowhere to lecture Luke who really isnt part of the movie at all than shooting lightning bolt to burn a tree down, D'Qar battle scene another take away from the empire strikes back, Luke making a hologram of himself so the rebellion can escape than disappearing into thin air, and many more all this stuff is supposed to give plots holes and fills plot holes and make a good story so when you walk out you will want to come back to see the next movie but you did not get a feeling for anything of that I myself was filled with anger and disappointment.Conclusion this movie fails along with all the other star wars movies Disney will make because star wars was not a universe made to be a comedy so it could sell things to little kids and band wagon fanboys.So what can we do about this first off the public needs to stop watching any movie made by JJ. Abrams and only give bad reviews to the point that people stop hiring him to write and direct movies and we need to stop feeding the money to Disney until they can make an actual good star wars movie they spent 2 billion dollars to get this franchise make them work for it or else you will only get bad movies from here on.\",\n",
       " \"Make no mistake, this is a monumentally bad movie. I should have known in hindsight to be honest. I have had the unfortunate experience to have seen some of Rian Johnson's previous films. Looper belongs in the death star garbage chute and Brick was a forgettable indie noir that felt like a poor man's (and by poor man I mean illiterate drunk hobo) Coen Brothers flick.Luke, Darth (father/Son) the battle between good and evil is basically the theme which dominates the original saga. Cross that with classical archetypes and the plot line of Zelda, King Arthur and the Princess and the Dragon trope and you have the 70's game changer. In the prequels of the 1990s, these themes follow (in a large degree albeit with terrible application) with the fall of Anakin and act alongside Abrahamic themes of the Fall of Man. These two conflicts: Lucas' personal relationship and the Judao-Christian father son (God/Man) relationship, have created film narratives that capture something we all know instinctively in all of us. This is why today, in the 21st century, Jedi has become an official religion (according to UK census rules), the cult of Star Wars fandom is pseudo religionist and Star Wars The Original Trilogy as a result, are timeless classics and remained the zeitgeist of Hollywood for a period of twenty five years after their original release. Sadly, the Star Wars Hollywood Zeitgeist is now firmly dead. This was confirmed within the first five minutes with The Last Jedi and its lame attempt to mimic today's zeitgeist of Hollywood: the Marvel franchise's self aware comedy. It was at that point the final nail in the coffin was hammered in home for me. What I hadn't been prepared for however, was how the rest of this long winded two and half hour tedious bore was so tragically awful.Let's start with the positives:1 Star rewarded to: Soundtrack. John Williams is a genius. Enough said. His score is outstanding and as usual, captures the individual themes with finesse.2nd Star awarded to: Special effects. No doubt about it, this has great effects and looks stunning from ILM and set the standard.3rd Star awarded to: all of the work Rian Johnson contributed to as I can't give him a zero.The Last Jedi is the epitome of style of content and plot with no narrative. Where it really fails however, is in the writing. The plot (other reviews cover this) is so boring, stupid and full of holes it makes swiss cheese more viewable. The fact that Rian Johnson has decided to reboot both Empire Strikes Back, The Prequels and Return of the Jedi in one film, is just plain lazy and fails. The 'comedy' aims for Marvel and instead hits Spaceballs (I laughed more than once at the film rather than with it). The dialogue aims for The Matrix and hits Phantom Menace. The antagonist in Star Wars, the Sith - the mythological equivalent of the Devil was always genuinely sinister. Couple this with the Space Nazis that the Empire represent and you had imaginative bad guys. The First Order in comparison, and with General Hux behaving more like Dwight Schrute from the American Office, are a complete joke. In fact this film reminded me more of Spaceballs and the prequels than it did original Star Wars. It does however just scrape ahead of Attack of The Clones of not taking the mantle of the Worst Star Wars Film Ever. But only just. Avoid. Please don't bother watching this forgettable tripe full of characters that make decisions that make no sense, talk forgettable lines and you couldn't care a less about. It is terrible.Also, how did this receive such positive reviews from the mainstream press on release? Could it be one of the biggest corporations in the world are manipulating our media? And how come IMDB have rated this 7.4?? All of the reviews I have seen are 3 or less... just a thought...\",\n",

So why the heck didn\\'t the order hyperspace something in front of the Raddus? Or even launch more fighters to take them down?

I cannot reason with the direction Luke has been pushed into, I can agree with some of the points he is making. Although disregarding the force and just letting Kylo go on his distructive past I cannot understand how Luke would allow this. I just don\\'t know....I can go on, but it\\'s not worth it.

Rey(Daisy Ridley) has sought out Luke taking with her Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon, but getting him to train her will be no easy task. Meanwhile General Leia(Carrie Fisher) is trying to keep the rebellion going, but that task is also not going well either...While it is good to see many of these characters again, like \"The Force Awakens\" this is a bleak and depressing film that is just not that compelling or well written. The story and direction(by Rian Johnson) feels cramped and patchy, despite the massive outer space battles, there is no sense of a galactic threat or high stakes, just the equivalent of two big street gangs fighting it out over a neighborhood that barely notices! Where Episode IX can go now that several (one was led to believe) key characters are killed off is really unclear, and unlike the first six episodes, there is no purpose to this new trilogy, just an unwise and unwanted unraveling of \"Return Of The Jedi\" in order to manufacture a way to keep this series going. Ultimately, it is just a sad, chaotic mess that has no meaning, and less point.',\n",
       " \"As you can tell from the title I found this movie disappointing. It goes down the same track as The Terminator, Alien and the Batman sequels*. (Briefly rescued by Nolan*). A powerful story turned into a shallow one due to weak writing and what appears to be no research conducted to understand the depth of the original storyline, the characters and the cross-over to this new era. Star Wars 1-6, Rogue One, Clone Wars, Rebels incorporates one great storyline. Creating a new storyline outside of this bubble is tough however it comes down to the writers ensuring the original is well researched when this new storyline is created. JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson have failed in this respect.Review:Firstly there is the odd gold nugget in this movie. I've read a lot of reviews about Yoda's laughter like a lunatic after the tree take-down moment and his overall appearance. IMO it was warming to see him appear at Luke's low point offering sage advice. It was a good moment. The part where Kylo Ren pulled back on killing his mother was notable and the hint of an alliance between Ren and Rey opened up some interesting possibilities with the story. Specific areas of frustration was where Luke Skywalker discarded his light-saber like it meant nothing. This was given to him by Obi Wan, was his fathers before him and was cut away from him by his Sith father. This item would not have been chucked so frivolously. I found an article where Rian noted this point and mentions that Luke is not going to fire it up and say, 'Let's go'. From Rian's perspective he stated Luke's done with that, that's why Luke's on the island. From my perspective I didn't expect him to 'Go' take on the First Order because he had his light-saber back. That is a very shallow point. I did expect him to reflect on a tangible part of his past being handed to him, I don't believe Luke would've chucked it. Based on his character, the epic history behind it and the sentimental connection he would have reflected on getting this item back, everything that had been occurring while he was away and likely passed this to Rey to be used for good after training her. Leia's Superman moment and Luke's green milk moment was terrible, the casino part of the movie was irrelevant, Finn getting rescued before his hero moment and Snoke being taken out was a let-down among many. Summary:Movie is watchable but if you're a passionate Star Wars fan you will be disappointed. Go in with very low expectations. :-(\",\n",

       " '\"If you see the Buddha, kill him.\" The Last Jedi (not really) Star Wars is Dead. RIP (But it\\'s worse than that)William MetzgerWarning: One big spoiler. If you have loved Star Wars since its inception and haven\\'t seen the Last Jedi don\\'t go. Don\\'t watch any more Star Wars sequels. Stop buying Star Wars merchandise. Disney has inverted everything Star Wars once was in order to subject a captivated audience to their politically correct, post-modernist, cultural-Marxist agenda. It has converted a story about brave Truth seekers relentlessly fighting evil into one of confused weaklings who preach \"everything\\'s relative dude.\" Star Wars has become the biggest bait and switch scam in history. You\\'ve been punked. Although the original Stars Wars was rich in political intrigue, great epic battles, wonderful human interest, colorful new species and amazing cultures, the heart and soul of Star Wars, the one thing that gave it lasting meaning, was Jedi mysticism. \"Luminescent you are, not this g matter\" said Master Yoda to the young disciple Luke Skywalker. At the core of Star Wars was a sacred and pure search for Truth, a rigorous discipline requiring total, lifelong, absolute faith and commitment, even celibacy. At the core was a relentless, single-minded dedication to overcoming the delusion of matter and ego-consciousness, to unifying one\\'s soul to the omnipresent, invisible Light, to the omnipotent Energy, and to the omniscient, eternal Consciousness that envelopes and binds the universe: the Force. Such knowledge is rare, and those capable of the receptivity and discipline to attain it very few indeed. Therefore, a small priesthood, the Jedi, kept the knowledge alive and pure. For the freedom fighters of the Republic it was enough to keep the faith. \"May the Force be with you\" was their battle slogan. Opposed to the Jedi were the Sith. The Sith practiced classic Luciferian doctrine as explained by Darth Sidius in episode III, Revenge of the Sith. The Jedi, according to Sidius, were limited in their powers and were preventing mankind from achieving its full potential by denying it access to the powers of the Dark Side. To access those powers, one must take the exact opposite path of the Jedi. Whereas the Jedi dissolved ego, the Sith immersed themselves in it. Whereas the Jedi operated within a moral framework and were motivated by love for all that is, the Sith found their powers by escaping moral boundaries and tapping into pure hate. In the first Star Wars trilogy we found the young adept, Luke Skywalker, and his young band of merry freedom fighters, battling the diabolical tyranny of Sith Lord Darth Vader and the Evil Empire, controlled by the enslaving power of the Dark Side. Throughout the trilogy we saw young Luke grow from a brave and talented, yet impetuous, egotistical, overconfident novice into a full Jedi under the strict training of Master Yoda.  Before his maturation as a Jedi, Luke studied for years and suffered many setbacks. In his first confrontation with Darth Vader, despite his undaunted courage, he was overpowered by Vader both physically and psychologically, losing his hand in battle, and reduced to trembling in fear in the face of the dark, frightening and much more powerful figure. And yet when the triumphant Vader mercifully offered the helplessly defeated Luke joint rulership of the galaxy in the name of peace, Luke\\'s Jedi heart and soul screamed out with no hesitation, \"I will never join you.\" Good and evil cannot mix.',\n",

       " \"This was a pretty poor effort for a Star Wars film, probably the worst I have seen, bar the holiday special. It strayed too far from the original Star Wars formula, the things that made the films great, and as a result it just didn't fit in that universe for me.It tried to be a hammy comedy where every second comment or reaction was an opportunity for a gag. The original trilogy got the comedy moments perfectly balanced, with just the odd throw away comment or expression from Han that kept it suitably light and entertaining. We didn't need a joke or cheap one-liner every other sentence. I actually felt like they put pauses in to let the jokes sink in for the slower members of the audience, who I really felt this film was really aimed at.Hux was a buffoon, consistently incompetent and not plausable as a ranking member of the order (influenced by Boris Johnson no doubt), that introduction to him falling for a crank call would have been more in place at Moe's tavern, not saying it wasn't funny but it killed the Star Wars vibe before it had even developed. When the bad guys consist of an idiot, a whiny teenager and a man made of used chewing gum, who dies half way through, it doesn't seem like there is a lot for the goodies to stress about beyond their own incompetence.Another great thing about the original Star Wars trilogy was the pacing, a little action here, a little plot development there, build the pace up to the action scene, bring it back down again. They were pretty masterfully paced, few films can match them, and this one certainly didn't. It dived straight into the action with a space battle in scene one, and basically never slowed down again. They literally dived from one action scene to the next throughout the whole film, with only the Luke and Rey scenes giving any change of pace, a beautiful balance of manic and boring. They should probably have made this over two or three movies, to get it all in with proper pacing, character development and a storyline that makes you care, or better yet, just not bothered.There was lot's of action in this film, far more than the original movies, mostly in that matrix style with zooms and slow mo bend backwards to dodge lightsabers type fight sequences, which were already getting old fashioned by the late 90s. They can still look good if done subtly, but these, like so much in this film, were not subtle, they just seemed to be in there as if someone was working through a checklist of things that make a movie good. A checklist that lacks anything to do with storyline.Eventually when it came to the end I was actually quite pleased. Then it didn't end, after the finale there was another action scene, followed by a finale, then another action scene, then...I was getting pretty desperate for it to end by then, it just dragged on.Final note, there was a bit of cuteness overload. We can't say that teh original trilogy didn't have that, Ewoks anyone? But it was a bit too much merchandising. For the young kids we had little things that are a cross between a guinnie-pig and a penguin, and for the slightly older kids foxes made of crystal-meth, or something like that. Anyway blatant merchandising opportunities.In summary...not much to say, I love Star Wars, but this one was pretty *****.\",\n",
       " \"I find this episode difficult to watch. As a childhood fan of Star Wars who has viewed each preceding episode countless times, I've watched Episode VIII three complete times: twice in the theater, once on Netflix. It is my opinion that the producers should have closed out the Skywalker Saga in the same style and manner as its predecessors, then twisted the force into a Marvel Universe megamess in a future series.I am curious to know what the producers where thinking when they approved the story and script of The Last Jedi, throwing away all the ideas and opportunities that were creatively written into The Force Awakens and it's predecessors. I don't know how they will pull out of this nose dive in Episode IX.Though I refuse to buy Episode VIII, reluctant to watch Solo and skeptical of Episode IX, I do believe there is hope for the future. I am a fan of the Clone Wars and look forward to new episodes. I loved Rogue One and consider it among the best Star Wars movies. I loved Rebels especially the stories in Seasons 1&amp;2 and look forward to The Mandalorian Series.Disney, you have some good writers and storytellers... use them.\",\n",
       " 'This is my first review ive ever written and its just something i felt i had to do. First, they killed Han Solo, now not only did they kill Luke they turned the whole movie into a bunch of cheesy one liners. I feel like they killed the image of who we all grew up believing Luke Skywalker to be. I like Rey, but feel like Star Wars as we knew it is gone and this is what we are left with. i did not enjoy the movie, although the visuals are very well done.',\n",
